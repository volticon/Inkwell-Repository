		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jake I just read through this and made a few minor grammatical changes. You listed journalism's 9 core values, but one thing I would add is to mention the 6-8 core values that you say ESPN has broken

“Everything we do as Reuters journalists has to be independent, free from bias and executed with the utmost integrity.” Reuters, one of the oldest and most respected news agencies in the world, has a pretty standard set of core values; ones that all news agencies must follow in order to be deemed credible and legitimate. Unfortunately not all journalistic institutions take these goals to heart. Recently, ESPN has been leading the way in chronicling the Bernie Fine scandal at Syracuse. But here lies the problem. Instead of reporting the news as it comes out, ESPN is making sure they “own” the story, controlling the way information is released, how it’s portrayed, and doing various things to control the story instead of reporting it.
The Pew Research Center, an award winning “fact tank,” sponsors the Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ), an initiative aimed at “…help[ing] both the journalists who produce the news and the citizens who consume it develop a better understanding of what the press is delivering, how the media is changing, and what forces are shaping those changes.” The book written by members of the organization: “The Elements of Journalism: What Newspeople Should Know and the Public Should Expect” by Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, which outlined nine core principles of journalism, won awards from Penn State, Sigma Delta Chi, and Harvard. In it’s coverage of the Bernie Fine scandal, ESPN violated at least six, and at worst eight, of those core values of journalism.

The Core Values described in the book are:
1. JOURNALISM'S FIRST OBLIGATION IS TO THE TRUTH
2. ITS FIRST LOYALTY IS TO CITIZENS
3. ITS ESSENCE IS A DISCIPLINE OF VERIFICATION
4. ITS PRACTITIONERS MUST MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENCE FROM THOSE THEY COVER
5. IT MUST SERVE AS AN INDEPENDENT MONITOR OF POWER
6. IT MUST PROVIDE A FORUM FOR PUBLIC CRITICISM AND COMPROMISE
7. IT MUST STRIVE TO MAKE THE SIGNIFICANT INTERESTING AND RELEVANT
8. IT MUST KEEP THE NEWS COMPREHENSIVE AND PROPORTIONAL
9. ITS PRACTITIONERS MUST BE ALLOWED TO EXERCISE THEIR PERSONAL CONSCIENCE

ESPN, and more directly Mark Schwartz, first learned of the accusations of sexual abuse by Bernie Fine in 2002. A then thirty year old Bobby Davis went to the police with the accusations that Fine molested him while Davis was a ball boy for the Syracuse basketball team, but was informed that the statute of limitations had expired on the charges, which supposedly happened from 1984, when Davis was twelve, until 2000, when Davis was 27. Davis, after the police route didn’t go anywhere, went to the Syracuse Post-Standard and ESPN, as well as Syracuse University with the accusations, and provided all three with the names of four or five people who Davis said would corroborate his story, including his step-brother Mike Lang. All those Davis said would corroborate his story denied any knowledge of any abuse. After thorough investigations by all three institutions came up empty, the Post-Standard and ESPN felt the stories did not meet their requirements for publication, and Syracuse University deemed the matter closed. But then the Penn State/Jerry Sandusky scandal happened, and that supposedly gave Davis’s step-brother Mike Lang, now 45, the courage to come forward. The second accuser gave Schwartz and ESPN the corroboration they needed to run the story.
In the interest of full disclosure, I am a very big Syracuse fan. Three members of my immediate family are grads, and I closely follow Syracuse’s football, basketball, and lacrosse teams. However, I also am a big fan of ESPN. I watch ESPN’s Mike and Mike in the Morning every morning, have three separate ESPN websites bookmarked, and have PTI and Around the Horn on iTunes. This is being written because a grossly dishonorable thing has been done, and I believe it to be wrong. This is not meant to be a defense or exoneration of Bernie Fine, as I am not saying that Fine is guilty or not guilty. My opinion of the matter is irrelevant. I am simply saying that the way ESPN has handled the reporting of the matter is deplorable.
In the past, journalists would take the information coming in off the AP wire (a machine that printed AP stories coming in off of telegraph wires) at the end of the day, and write their stories for the next day’s newspaper with an emphasis on accuracy and writing talent. Now, in the Internet Age of instant news, the emphasis is on being the first to report a story, to “own” the story. The Penn State/Jerry Sandusky scandal was an embarrassment for ESPN. The Poynter Review Project used its role as ombudsman of ESPN to criticize the network’s coverage of the scandal, saying “With the biggest staff of sports journalists in the world, ESPN should have been leading the charge to ask tough questions and shed light on this scandal. Instead, it was the tiny Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Pa. out in front of the journalism pack.” They went on to emphasize that it took 72 hours for ESPN’s coverage to find the “appropriate moral outrage.” Most important in the Poynter Review Project’s column was their belief that “Doria (ESPN’s Director of News) didn't articulate a specific strategy that would have ESPN steering the story, rather than simply reacting to it. We were hoping to see more of the former early on in the news cycle. […] We were particularly dismayed Tuesday morning, when ESPN and its vast resources seemed to be behind the curve, failing to turn up new information or advance the story and instead sounding tone deaf to the nature of this story.” Now keep in mind, this coverage of the Penn State scandal was after the result of a three year police investigation and a 23 page grand jury report were made public outlining multiple allegations of sexual abuse by Jerry Sandusky, along with testimony from those involved and with the conclusion of the grand jury being that there was an institutional cover-up of the sexual abuse of multiple children. In other words, facts were known, inconsistencies ironed out, and legitimacies confirmed. It seems as though after these criticisms of their reporting of the Penn State scandal, ESPN has swung too far to the other side. Their reporting of the Bernie Fine scandal has the appropriate moral outrage befitting the Penn State story, one where facts had been previously discovered and vetted, and testimony taken and recorded. The fact that they didn’t “steer the story” and were outdone by the Harrisburg News is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s a very good thing. ESPN is not Big Brother. The 2nd core value of journalism is that journalists have a responsibility to the people, not to their organization. If all the journalism was to come from one place, such as the Poynter Review seems to want from ESPN, then it would be impossible to find varied points of view or unbiased coverage, two staples of journalism itself. Sometimes it is best for small, local organizations to take leads on important issues, as they rarely have large corporate interests, have fewer people to appease, and allow for the large media outlets to (hopefully) focus on the fair and equitable reporting and analysis of the information to the masses. Also, criticizing ESPN for not “steering” the story and merely “reacting” to it is offensive to the very core of journalistic integrity. A journalist should not attempt to control a story, to put his or her own spin on it. “Reacting” to a story is good journalism. Core Value #1 states “This "journalistic truth" is a process that begins with the professional discipline of assembling and verifying facts. Then journalists try to convey a fair and reliable account of their meaning." Nowhere in there is anything about controlling a story. In fact, the second sentence of the first Core Value of Journalism sounds a whole lot like reacting to information.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>It&#039;s as Complicated as Black vs. White</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The recent tragedy immediately became a racial issue. When Trayvon Martin was shot on February 26th, the entire country seemed to suddenly become involved. But as unfortunate as this incident was, murder in America is not uncommon; in fact, there are over 40 murders a day in the United States. And yet this death has gathered significantly more media attention than any of the others in recent memory. The murder of Trayvon Martin has received the attention it has, simply because Trayvon was black, and his shooter, George Zimmerman, was not. Zimmerman prefers to identify himself as Latino, but most news sources have reported him as Caucasian. The blatant truth is that Trayvon Martin’s murder is only news because it has been labeled a racial hate crime, which it very well might not be. Black leaders like “Reverend” Al Sharpton have flocked to Florida to bring media attention to the incident, while also filling their pockets along the way. And their entire argument is based off the assumption that Zimmerman’s side of the story is false (there is a witness who has confirmed his story and a witness who has painted a different picture). Would Sharpton have gone to Florida if the victim had been an Irish Boy? Would NAACP leaders have even known about the incident if the victim had been Jewish instead? Would this incident been on the news if the shooter had also been black? Another civil rights leader, Jesse Jackson, was quick to declare that “blacks are under attack,” but it is statements like this by people like him that prohibit the racial equality that these people claim to be fighting for.

Over the past few years there have been several incidents in which Caucasians were brutally murdered by minorities. While I am not saying that the Trayvon Martin Case deserves less media attention than it is getting, I do believe that these incidents deserved more attention than they got. In early 2007, a couple in Knoxville, Tennessee was carjacked, tortured, raped, and murdered by four men and one woman. This case failed to make national headlines, and is still not very well known. It was later said about the case “This [case] doesn’t fit any political agenda. It’s not a useful crime. Reverse the races and just imagine how the national media would cover the story of a young black couple murdered by five white assailants." While I am not defending any of those at fault, hate crimes have become an unfortunate double standard. Just last week, several African Americans attacked and lit on fire a thirteen year old white boy while yelling out “this is what you deserve, white boy.” This particular story has not been featured on any national news programs, but is just as disturbing as the Trayvon Martin Story.

The media outcry for Trayvon Martin is appropriate, but for the wrong reasons. President Obama shouldn’t acknowledge this horrible tragedy just because he shares the same skin tone as Trayvon, or because his hypothetical son “would look like Trayvon.” And while it is difficult to defend George Zimmerman, could he really make out Martin’s ethnicity on a dark and rainy night while the teen was wearing a hoodie? Moreover, Zimmerman did have good reason to be armed: police had been called to the neighborhood 46 times last year, due to several robberies, some of which were armed robberies. In addition, Martin is far from the perfect kid as he has been made out to be; pictures accompanying several articles were altered to make him look more innocent and less like a ‘thug.' While Martin's personality does not justify his murder, he was known to have several tattoos, and he has been suspended from school several times for assault on a bus driver and for possession of marijuana with suspicion of distribution. Martin uploaded pictures to his Twitter account, which uses a handle with a very offensive racial slur (@NO_LIMIT_N***A), in which he is showing off gold teeth and several tattoos, and later giving the camera the middle finger. A witness confirmed George Zimmerman’s story, claiming that he saw Martin on top of Zimmerman, not the other way around, and that it was Zimmerman who was yelling for help. Maybe we shouldn’t be so quick to judge things as they might stereotypically appear.

What happened to Trayvon Martin is a tragedy, but I do not believe that it should be made a racial issue. Because of one victim’s ethnicity, our country should not divide itself along strict racial lines. By making the issue a racial one, and therefore separating Americans, we are restricting ourselves from actually achieving the equality we all want.

As of March 28th, 2012, George Zimmerman has not been arrested.

The above photo was intentionally photoshopedd, apparently to make Martin look less like a thug and more like an innocent.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Worst Company in America: EA Games?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, Electronic Arts won the Worst Company in American award for 2012, beating out Bank of America. Naturally, an uproar followed. Many felt it was absurd that a video game company had been voted as being worse than a bank, and that gamers were being whiny or had very skewed prioities. However, I feel that the words of William Usher, a writer for cinemablend.com, sum up the sentiments of all who voted for EA:
<blockquote>"If you don't know why, it's not just over the <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Mass-Effect-3-Extended-Cut-DLC-Fix-Ending-41141.html"><em>Mass Effect 3</em> ending</a>, it's over <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Origin-Scans-Your-PC-Auto-Add-Steam-Games-Library-39973.html">Origin</a> [an online service that sells digital downloads], it's over <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/games/EA-Says-Some-Online-Passes-Supposed-Expire-37500.html">Project $10</a> [which made purchasers of used games pay an extra $10 to access online feature], it's over <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/games/EA-Sports-MMA-Multiplayer-Shutting-Down-Soon-40599.html">early server closings</a>, it's about <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Child-Play-Responds-EA-DLC-They-Did-Have-Our-Permission-Run-Promotion-41190.html">DLC charity abuse</a>, it's over them gutting studios like Pandemic, Westwood, Origin Studios and Bright Light, it's over the lawsuits, it's over the nickel-and-diming with <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/games/EA-Responds-Accessing-Disc-DLC-Mass-Effect-3-40358.html">Day-1 DLC</a>, and everything else in between. If you didn't know any of that then you're not informed enough to say why people shouldn't have voted for EA."</blockquote>
So no, gamers are not just bitter over the Mass Effect 3 ending. They are tired of being taken advantage of, and this whole thing boils down to consumers becoming fed up with being exploited. Say Apple releases a new product, knowing that they will release a program update for sale the same day the product is released. People would utterly freak out and it would be all over TV, newspapers and other media. However, there seems to be a huge tendency of downplaying issues in the gaming industry as nothing more than the complaints of Xbox junkies with no lives. EA Games being voted the Worst Company in America is an affirmation of consumer discontent, but so long as customers continue to feed into the madness by continuing to buy content released the same day or content that is overpriced, EA will keep taking advantage.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Club Convention: Resume Padding or Genuine Interest?</title>

<strong>victoria: edited what was written so far. maybe get a quote from someone concerning the club convention instead of just stating that it "appeared to be a big hit."</strong><strong> definitely mention some past clubs that perhaps were not as active and created solely for the pleasure of being able to state "founder and president" on resume, though you will probably not be able to get anybody on the record for that. </strong><strong>you could interview deb schoman about the new club standards (i.e how they actually have to be productive), the specifics of when and why that was put in place. other people to interview: students who are NOT in any clubs vs. those in MANY clubs for their POVs.</strong> <strong>other possible research: myth or fact, juniors join and create clubs because they are just realizing the college deadline is approaching, what freshmen vs. old-hand seniors think. also, remember: less "I asked" and more "when asked" and please give the people you interview some explanatory epithets (e.g, senior Sydney Menzin, Director of College Counseling Lauren Carballo). otherwise, the story seems on the right track, keep up the good work!</strong>

The recent club convention appeared to be a big hit with many students in attendance, but it begs the question: are students joining clubs out of genuine interest? Or, do they join for perks such as food, club apparel, and a college resume boost? To discover more about students' real motivation for joining clubs, I talked to senior Sydney Menzin, current president of the Diversity Club.

When asked about what role clubs play in the college process, Sydney said, “I think that participating in clubs is a great way to explore your options and demonstrate your interests to colleges. However, make sure your intention is centered around the enjoyment of the experience, rather than simply having another activity to add to a resume.” After getting Sydney's opinion on the topic, I asked Mrs. Carballo of the College Office for her perspective. According to the Associate Director of College Counseling, “joining clubs is also important in the college process, as a student's resume shows potential colleges his or her interests and involvement. Colleges can, therefore, predict whether or not a particular student will be an active member or even leader in their community.”

Clubs sometimes though are used as just "resume stuffers" to try

<strong>(PRESENT OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY HERE; CLUBS AS CYNICAL RESUME STUFFERS, KIDS CREATING THEM AS JUNIORS, USE ANONYMOUS SOURCES IF NEED BE BUT TRY TO GET SOMEONE ON THE RECORD)</strong>

So how exactly do we find the balance between? Although it’s important to build up your resume and make yourself as a candidate look strong and like a leader, it’s High School. There is an opportunity to create a balance by finding a club that grabs your interests as well as your attention to work hard and succeed in it. Friends Academy has so many clubs to offer and if there isn’t one that interests you, than start your own club! The point of Clubs is to take a break from the classroom and find something that you are truly passionate about and through that show your leadership skills and abilities to succeed.

		<title>Fall Fashion Update</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Victoria: This seems a little out of season now, if it still hasn't been published. Maybe we can do a winter update instead?</strong>

<strong></strong><strong>Katrina: Do we have pictures for this?</strong>

Fall is usually the season for comfy sweaters and oversized scarves, but this season, fall is being shaken up with comebacks and new statement colors. The major colors being shown throughout the stores this season are burgundy, pumpkin orange and various jewel tones. The tweed pattern, which we all know and love, is also making a major comeback. We can be sure to see more of this classic pattern in various skirts and jackets this fall. If you are looking for a comfortable and practical pair of shoes, try a pair of oxfords.  Not only are they easy to wear with any outfit, but also stylish, affordable and in dress code!

Have you ever seen bracelet stacks in magazines that consist of various metals and wondered how you could pull off this trend? The answer to successfully pulling off this trend of mixing metals is to include various textured bracelets in your stack.  For example, you should add bracelets with leather or woven material for a fun pop. In this statement, context is key, so add textures that contain various colors that will blend well with metallic colors!  Friends Academy students can find these trends at dress code friendly stores like JCrew, Orvis, Rugby, Old Navy, and Vineyard Vines!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why should you learn to program?</title>

<ul>
	<li>ease into article</li>
	<li>change format?</li>
	<li>Why is cs compelling</li>
	<li>title</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Without software the world would be radically different.</strong></h3>
Software surrounds you. From your microwave to you brand-new iPhone 5 that you can’t stop looking at, you interact with software multiple times a day. Whether you realize it or not, you depend on it to go about your day-to-day life. Yet still, the majority of people remain dependent on a select few to equip them with these powerful programs.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>A Computer Science Major?</strong></h3>
Computer Science may not be for you, but you should definitely try it with some depth. My teacher in an introductory course to Computer Science made a reference exemplifying how one could possibly find a passion. He used the example of learning an instrument when young. Your mom or dad may have persistently forced you to practice that insipid instrument, but nonetheless you got good at it. You finally were allowed to quit and you did, but you soon realize that you like playing the instrument when it is not required. That’s why you need to try Computer Science and programming with vigor. It largely boils down to the fact that people like what they are good at. Perhaps computational thinking becomes second nature to you and you can write extensive and impressive programs. Maybe you’ve discovered a passion but rather <em>invented</em> one.

Computer Science is not limited. Contrastingly, Computer Science has very few limits. There are departments for a large realm of people. One can program games, create movie special effects, write a program to help doctors store medical reports, and produce artificial intelligence. An innovator might even produce a department that doesn’t even exist at this moment. The field of computers and technology is expanding at an exceptionally high rate, simply because there is an perpetual desire for tools that complete tasks for us or entertain us.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Not a Computer Science major? I still recommend you learn how to program.</strong></h3>
A recent report came out that Stanford’s most popular major is now Computer Science and 90 percent of all students take at least one Computer Science course.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>edits by victoria: photos? also, is it stonybrook or stony brook?</strong>

The Boys Championship Varsity Basketball Game against Stony Brook was full of excitement on Tuesday night, March 5. We had a lot of support from the Friends Academy community. The basketball game came close to a victory, but unfortunately, in the end, we did not win. However, the scores were close throughout the game. At the end of the first quarter, FA had 11 and Stony Brook had 15. By the second quarter, FA fell a couple more points behind with a score of 13 for FA and 28 for Stony Brook. Our team during the half time had a serious meeting in which they set their minds to coming back and winning. This was shown at the end of the 3rd quarter when FA had 21 and Stony Brook had 28. Even though FA worked hard and played until the very end, it was not enough to win the game. The final score was 34 for FA and 43 for Stony Brook. Either way, the Friends Academy Boys Varsity Basketball team put up a great fight and had a terrific season. Until next year boys and congratulations to having made it to the championships!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the founding of Friends Academy in 1876, The “athletes” that don’t play a spring sport have been forced to play badminton.  But in 2013, the monumental decision to change the spring season’s Physical Education requirement from Badminton to European Handball was made…  Thus begins our quest to discover the reasoning behind this controversial decision.  So we figured we would start at the source of the problem… and ask the librarians…

Unfortunately Andy had accumulated 4 DP’s within the library this semester, and was therefore not permitted to be in the library.  Our only results: another DP, and some very angry librarians.

It was a slow start to our journey but we didn’t lose heart and decided to take our questions to someone who was sure to have some interesting insight on the new P.E. arrangement, First Year Student and sophomore, Phillip Chen.  Jonny and I weren’t surprised to find that the 16-year-old boy from China reflected a particular bias towards Badminton.

“I hate handball and I was really looking forward to a season of competitive badminton.”

He later informed us that when not playing hockey, he would spent his time at the NYC Badminton Club in Manhattan preparing himself for a grueling spring P.E. season.  Furthermore Phillips handball team’s 0-2 records also contributes to his dislike of the sport.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To the naked eye, the girls at Friends Academy seem to get a long very well. As a junior boy, I realize that this is definitely not the case. After 7 years at Friends Academy I’ve been privilege to be given a little bit on the inside of the Friends Academy girls life and realize that this is definitely not the case so I decided to take it upon myself to uncover this story.

When I started my research on this topic, I decided to get a third parties opinion on this topic so I started to ask teacher. After talking to several teachers, I was able to find out that most of these teachers have similar views on female students: They appear to be friendly and enjoying themselves with each other. “Most girls look friendly to each other, laughing, and enjoying themselves.” Said one teacher. These teachers are very wrong on what is truly happening in the girl world.

To start my research, I started to talk to some upperclassmen. Knowing these students for quite sometime now, I was able to pick up when they were lying. I kept getting consistent lies like “Yeah girls talk to each other just like boys do. Were just as close as guys and we feel like we can talk to each other about anything.” But in reality none of this is true. Why were these girls feeling hesitant to share how they really feel about each other? It can be from several different reasons: 1) They are embarrassed. They do not want to admit to a guy the truth about girls. 2) They did what most girl who I interviewed explained to me the basic girl actions, lied.

After finishing interviewing the upperclassmen, I decided to interview the underclassmen. While talking to these girls I got the honest real truth about girls: Every girl secretly hates each other.  “Every girl is really dramatic, very obnoxious, two faced, so fake, not trustable, no such thing as a girl best friend, prone to text fights, pr<span style="line-height: 1.5;">r but really doesn’t and catty” This is the overarching quote that I came up with after interviewing many girls. The</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">etends to like each othese are true to an extent that I saw it happen right in front of me. While talking to 5 freshman girls, they started to answer my questions. Later they gave me specific examples of these incident. They had so much hatred towards this girl that they wanted me to call out this person in my article. These girls showed me the true side of the girl life at Friends Academy.</span>

After my adventure to try to figure out the truths of the girl world I was able to uncover the mysteries of the girl world. All quotes will remain anonymous as asked by everyone who was interviewed. Although realistically this problem will not be solved soon, I encourage girls to work on these problems and hopefully eventually stop these girl problems. I thank everyone who took the time to be interviewed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The gentlemen of Friends Academy have been looking awfully fashionable this fall.  The ever dapper bow-tie made a comeback last year in the male population at Friends Academy.  This year, bow-ties can be spotted quite frequently again across campus. Whether male students are securing clip-ons or tying knots, bow-ties will continue to make an appearance on campus (at least until I graduate). <strong>[Ask Mr. Lape about his love of bow ties- direct quotes are great for articles]</strong>

The reintroduction of the cowl/shawl sweater in the sophomore class...<strong>[expand on these sweaters and get a quote from a sophomore who wears these sweaters]</strong>

Sperry boat shoes have lost their laces and the men of Friends Academy must pick a side: the classic laces that often come undone or the new crisscrossed laces that are unconventional yet practical.  Perhaps, boys should just skip the Sperry controversy altogether and instead wear Cole Haan loafers.

There are still some fashion questions for which the answer is still uncertain. Will Timberlands make a come back? Could students see the return of elbow-pads? How are the freshmen coping with the task of fastening a tie every morning? Only time, dress code, climate and clothing prices will determine the dominant male fashion trends this year.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Congratulation to the FA boys soccer team for winning states this year! In addition to winning states, the FA boy’s soccer team was ranked 6th over all in the state which includes all of the classes. The team was able to over come many challenges constantly being the underdog but proving that that was not the case. The boy’s team won most of their games in blow out fashion showing why they were state champs. 
During the playoffs the team was carried by their veteran senior captain Jonny Nierenberg. Constantly coming up with the big goal when the team needed it including the solo goal in the championship game. “It was a great team effort throughout the entire playoffs. Everyone was gave all their effort and without that we wouldn’t have won.” Said Jonny. 
The team also benefited by crucial throw ins by fellow senior, Patrick Moodhe. Moodhe has the raw ability to throw the ball across the field to the goal allowing his teammates a chance to head the ball and score. In fact, most of the goals scored during the playoffs were scored this way including the lone goal in the championship game. Needless to say, Patrick Moodhe’s monstrous throw ins helped lead the team to victory. After talking to junior Jason Baskind he told me that, “Moodhe has the most dangerous throw in in the league. No other team has this weapon. It is one of the most amazing weapons that any sports team has every had.”
The team wasn’t just a team but a family. “We were a family, everyone on the team was apart of the game. Even the bench players who weren’t playing were apart of the game. Without the help of everyone we wouldn’t have won.” Said junior Thomas Frey.  They were united as a team, which eventually helped, lead the team to victory. 
The team is very happy with their season and is upset that it is over. They thank the support of the school and everyone who came out to their games during the entire season. Congratulations to the boy’s soccer team on an amazing season.

		<title>Friends Academy Squash Team</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have participated in US Squash sanctioned tournaments since I was 9 years old.  One of my favorite aspects of a US Squash tournament is the referee system.  After each match, both the winner and loser have to officiate the next match on their court.  Although this system can be frustrating for the loser (who probably just wants to go home) it also serves to create lasting friendships between opponents.  The US Squash referee system basically forces fellow juniors to sit down together after their match and work together for at least half an hour.  As you can imagine, after 8 years of tournaments, I have gotten to know a lot of junior players, and nearly all of them participate for their school’s squash team.  Hence, I decided to start a squash team at FA. The team consists of roughly 15 kids, both beginners and tournament seasoned players, and we practice 3 days a week at the Creek Club.  Mr. Nelson and my long time coach, Khaled Sobhy (a former top professional player from Egypt, and an internationally renowned coach) are serving as the team’s trainers.  Throughout the season we hope to organize a few matches against nearby schools with squash programs, and our primary goal is to qualify for US Squash’s National High school Championship (an annual event hosted a Yale for the 80 best high school teams in the country).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Are Tutors Fair?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A lot of students receive tutoring for classes and standardized tests, especially at Friends Academy. Are the tutored students cheating?</div>
<div></div>
<div>If the "tutors" are actually doing the academic work for the student, it is cheating.  The students may never get caught, but they probably know that what they are doing is wrong. and hopefully karma will catch up with them. If students hire their specific teachers, who have "inside" information about specific grading and testing in class, the tutoring is also cheating.  I am sure that many teachers would disagree, but the fact is that teachers cannot help but tutor to their tastes.  When the tutor is the classroom teacher, that innate bias gives an unfair advantage to one student over every other student in that class.  This is an advantage that outside tutors simply cannot provide.  Additionally, when school teachers tutor their own students it negatively affects the moral of the entire class due to the appearance of an unfair advantage. Having to cope with that suspicious atmosphere in the classroom, unfairly punishes the untutored kids.  (However, going to get extra help from a teacher on an unpaid basis is fine as long as all of the students have equal access to that free help.  If a teacher offers that free help to only some students, it would again be cheating. But that would be a favoritism type of cheating. Nothing to do with tutoring per se.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>If the tutors are outside hires paid to help students study or learn more efficiently and successfully then tutoring cannot be considered cheating.   Why? Because although tutoring may give some students an advantage over other students, attempting to improve oneself simply cannot be a crime.  Life is full of honest advantages and disadvantages.  Tutoring is just one more of them.  Other similar advantages might be the fact that some kids have nicer homes with better work spaces in which to do their homework. And some kids have higher IQs than other students.   Some kids have parents who discuss homework issues with them.  Some kids have siblings that have taken the classes in previous years and offer advice.  All of these situations (and many others) are advantageous, while not being cheating.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is unfair that affluent students can afford tutors while less affluent students who need help cannot afford them.  But that does not make the use of tutors cheating.  It does however make the accomplishments of those who cannot afford tutors that much  more impressive.  Just like an athlete who makes varsity with no outside coaching, getting great grades without a tutor is something to be proud of.</div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The creatively written science fiction novel, "Divergent" is must read for anyone looking to spice up their leisurely reading. Author Veronica Roth paints a world where people are divided into five factions. The factions are Candor, Erudite, Abnegation, Amity, and Dauntless. Each of the factions believe in different moral codes that one should follow. For example, the people of Candor always tell the truth, no matter how harsh it may be. In this fictional society, once children reach adulthood, they must chose whether to stay with their family in the faction they grow up in, or switch to a different one. Once the choice is made, there is no looking back. <span style="line-height: 1.5">The main character, Beatrice Prior, must make the most important decision of her life. Will she stay with her family in Abnegation, or leave to explore a new life in a different faction? Her choices have strong </span>repercussions, and all that she loves is hanging on a thin thread. <span style="line-height: 1.5"> </span>

"Divergent" may be fiction, but it challenges real life issues. This is a book not easily forgotten.

		<title>Small Ways to Make a Difference in Earth Month</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Not only is it the beginning of spring, but it's also the start of Earth month! Earth month is significant because it reminds us to celebrate Earth's natural beauty. In fact, Earth day, April 22, is the most celebrated environmental event in the world. Earth Day marks the anniversary of the first environmental movement in America.  In the 1970s, Earth Day sprung out of a proposal made by John McConnell, a peace activist from The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conference in California.  The Earth Day Network coordinated the celebration of Earth Day (and Earth Month) with the purpose of increasing awareness about environmental issues. Today, Earth day is recognized and celebrated in 192 countries. The primary purpose of Earth Day is to encourage the public to appreciate and protect the environment. In an effort to protect our planet, we need to keep it clean. I’m sure we are all familiar with the famous “R’s”: reduce, reuse, and recycle. In addition, we need to be careful with purchases of items that come in wasteful packaging. Reuse your canteens rather than constantly buying drinks in plastic bottles and throwing them in the trash. If anything, recycle them! Step out of your comfort zone. Form a group of you and your friends and visit a park to help clean up a little bit. Even the simplest actions make a huge difference. Close the faucet when you’re brushing your teeth. If a faucet leaks one drop per second, about 1,300 gallons are going to waste. If it’s hot water, that’s even worse because it also wastes fossil fuels, resulting in more greenhouse gasses. Maybe you want to reduce your energy bill. Change your lightbulbs to Compact Fluorescent Lamps, or CFLs. Not only do they provide better light but they last ten times longer than regular bulbs. They only consume 1/4 the amount of energy and 90% less heat. If you really want to get in touch with earth, plant a tree! Along with providing shade, keeping homes cooler, but trees also grant $62,000 worth of air pollution control and $31,250 worth of soil erosion. There are infinitely many ways to celebrate and give back to our Earth to make it a healthier place. But remember, you should live everyday like it’s Earth day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Multiple concussions, torn ACLs, coupled with dozens of torn muscles and ligaments are testaments to the tough fall season every sports team is facing. Due to our previously successful seasons, FA has moved up to a class with larger and more competitive schools. This move is proving strenuous on our athletes and is causing the number of injured players to dramatically increase. On the Girls Varsity Soccer team alone, three concussions, one pulled knee and a severe ankle sprain have lead to several JV players being pulled up and helping out. This in turn creates a problem for the JV that was already lacking numbers. The Girls Soccer program is among the other fall sports teams who are low on numbers and have injured players resulting from physical games. Going forward, the athletic department will have to make decisions on ways to keep our teams in competitive leagues while making sure our rate of injury stays low.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[American girls, who have fare skin, are known for their desire to have tan skin. In order to do so they tan, spray tan or apply tanning cream to obtain the desired “sun kissed” look. Being tanned is beautiful, American’s believe this, but the billboards and magazines in other countries, like India, tell another story.

India’s idea of beauty is having pale almost white skin. But its not just India, in Africa, Latin America and even Asia, women are glorified for having lighter complexions.  Similar to Americans, they find a way to alter their skin tones. How do they do it? They apply a variety of bleaching creams. It seems like applying a cream to alter ones skin tone is no big deal, because of the similarity to how Americans tan their skin to acquire beauty.

Skin bleaching, like tanning, has its health hazards, but apart from the physical risks, skin bleaching is a mental health hazard as well. Skin bleaching can trigger self -hatred and racism, two very serious issues that can severely affect the mental health of a person. Americans love tanning their skin but the media industry is not preoccupied with sun kissed bodies. In American media, there is a diversity of skin tones. For example, Americans believe Tyra Banks and Gisele Bundachen are beautiful but they are not the same skin tone. On the other hand, In India the only way to enter the media industry, which includes film, television and modeling, is to have pale skin. These industries are fueling racism by discriminating against darker skinned Indians and making dark Indians feel as if they aren’t beautiful.

<strong><em>[Will's Note: I'm not sure if this "American girl's being fair-skinned'  business is politically correct, what with the 12% of the country that is Black or African American. Some of these claims seem as though they came from a source, but there are no citations (i.e. "skin bleaching can trigger self-hatred and racism"). Grammer is a bit dubious. Oh, and if my criticisms weren't overwrought enough already, the thesis and closing sentences posit to different points, making for a rather feeble argument.]</em></strong>]]></content:encoded>

You can only eat sandwiches for so long until they start tasting the cardboard. To make it worse they took away the burgers too. No chicken no burgers. This is ‘Merica for God sakes where is our food! Land of the free home to no chicken.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s insane how many DPs get handed out in the Library. Library is not made for work its made for socializing and the sooner the Librarians learn this the better. No resentment to them, they are great women but we will never conform to learning. Mrs. Van Auken&gt; Everyone. Just wait for the library gets on lock down again. Watch what you do though, the librarians always win.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Waiting four years for ultimate privilege of leaving meeting first seems like a small deal for anyone who doesn’t go to the academy. Little do they know that’s the dream. Being a senior I’m not too sure if I like being the first out of meeting because its more convenient or just because of principle. Realistically, where am I going? I’m rushing to go to a club and when I get there, I just have to wait 30 minutes for the freshman to finally get out of the theater. Bottom line: Seniors first is a very important rule and should not be broken.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The most important rule in the school is also the least followed rule, testing weeks. In my 4 years at the academy, I have heard the phrase “It’s not your testing week but if its okay with you guys I’m going to give you a test anyways” so many times it makes my head spins. Meanwhile I’m the only kid in the class opposing to it because I have 5 tests that week. Although teachers mean well and do it for the students convenience it never works out. They’re important remember them

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Halloween is one of the most exciting times of years, where todlers through adults, have the power to show of their creative, spooky, and silly side.  Halloween is not only a holiday celebrated by people all over the world, yet a culture that has developed, being celebrated in many different ways.

A recent survey taken  by the National Retail Federation estimated that about $2.6 billion dollars will be spent by Americans this year on Halloween costumes alone.  This survey reveals that $1.2 billion of that will be spent on childrens costume, while $1.4 billion will be spent on adults costumes, leaving $330 million to be put towards pet costumes.  Also reported in this survey, are the type of costumes that are predicted to be the most popular this year.  Americans are predicted to choose traditional costumes, including vampires, witches, superheroes, animals, and princesses. These costumes are overall the top 10 most popular Halloween costumes on the internet.

The two most

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

Other costumes on the list also have been popular for a long time, but may have received a recent boost from recent attention in pop culture. For example, in 2012 zombies were the ninth most popular costume for children, and the fifth most popular for adults. This year, they are seventh among children and fourth among adults. The NRF estimates the number of people masquerading as the dead should increase by more than a quarter million this Halloween.

Marvel, DC Comics and the companies that produce superhero costumes also will have another big year. An estimated 4.1% of all people dressing up for Halloween said they planned to<a href="http://247wallst.com/special-report/2013/10/29/this-years-most-popular-halloween-costumes/#"> wear</a> an action hero or superhero costume, the fourth most popular answer. And that is only among those who did not specify which hero they were going to be. Batman characters were the second most popular choice. Other Halloween favorites include Superman and Spider-Man.

Halloween has always been considered a holiday for children. This year, however, according to the survey, there actually will be more adults<a href="http://247wallst.com/special-report/2013/10/29/this-years-most-popular-halloween-costumes/#"> wearing</a> costumes. While adults and children share several of the same top costumes, there are notable exceptions. For example, princesses, by far the most popular costume for children, are only tied for 17th for adults. Vampires, the third most popular costumes for adults, are 13th for children.

To identify this year’s most popular Halloween costumes, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the<a href="http://www.nrf.com/"> National Retail Federation</a>’s 2013 Halloween Consumer Spending Survey. The results are based on the number of adults and children who knew what they were going to be, with a million adults still undecided at the time of the survey.

These are this year’s most popular Halloween costumes.

Last April Fool's Day, women and mens clothing company, "American Eagle Outfitters", revealed a soon to come store known as "American Beagle Outfitters".  Just as it sounds, American Beagle Outfitters is a clothing line for dogs.  The catch is, when American Eagle Outfitters first showed this idea it was presented as a joke, however customers soon wanted to buy "AE" designs for their dogs, causing the production of American Beagle to occur.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Life Without The NFL</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s a scary thought, isn’t it? It’s something that seems impossible and very hard to imagine. We have been raised in a world where the NFL is more than a super-power. It is a presence that is in every corner of the nation. Seemingly everybody knows what those three letters mean. N.F.L… National Football League. It is an unbeatable force, an immovable object. And we may be seeing the end of it.

Back in March, Dallas Mavericks (NBA) owner Mark Cuban said that he thinks that the NFL is heading towards the end. He believes that the NFL is getting too big to control. He was alluding to the NFL’s constant attempts to rule the world. The NFL wants football to be the only sport that anyone cares about, and they don’t even try to hide it.

The NFL Draft usually takes place in April, but this past one was from May 8 until May 10. The NFL said that the reason it moved the date was because of a scheduling conflict at Radio City Music Hall, where the draft is every year. That’s where I call their bluff. You’re the NFL. You are by far the biggest and most popular league in professional sports. There are no scheduling conflicts for you. There is <i>absolutely </i>no doubt that if you want a certain venue at a certain time, it’s yours. Not to mention the fact that it is at the <i>same exact place</i> at the <i>same exact time </i>every single year. It’s not like if I came out of the blue and told the people at Radio City that I needed the stage during the Christmas Spectacular. It’s the freaking National Football League scheduling a yearly event that everyone in the country knows is coming.

As if that wasn’t enough proof that the NFL was trying to take over the American sports world, Sports Illustrated recently released an article talking about the NFL’s TV deals in relation to other sports. It talked about how the NFL used to cooperate with Major League Baseball during the World Series and not schedule any games so that the two leagues were not competing for viewers. This year the NFL scheduled multiple games that conflicted with crucial MLB playoff games, including two during the World Series. Not only were the two games during the World Series, they were also in prime time. Not only were they during the World Series and in prime time, but each game also contained at least one team that wasn’t from a baseball market. For example, the Green Bay Packers and the New Orleans Saints are both from cities that don’t have baseball teams, and they both played in prime time during the World Series. By putting those teams in their respective games, the NFL was trying to maximize its viewership. If the NFL put the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs (the two teams playing in the World Series) as two of the prime time matchups, it is safe to say that the majority of people would still watch the football games rather than the baseball games, regardless of the fact that the baseball games were far more significant. By choosing to put two non-baseball markets in the games, they made sure that both of those cities would have their focus on the NFL. If the Yankees were in the World Series and the Jets were on Thursday Night Football, many of the people in New York would watch the Yankees game if they coincided. However, if you were a Saints fan and the World Series was on and the Saints were on Monday Night Football, nearly the entire Louisiana market would be watching football.

The NFL has its sights set on more than just America, however. They want to rule the world. Every year, the NFL plays multiple games in Europe, which is the league trying to grow its vast fanbase overseas. The Jacksonville Jaguars are a team that plays at least one game at London’s Wembley Stadium. Coincidentally, the Jaguars have been the subject of discussion about relocation for several years now. By making them play in London, the NFL is entertaining the thought of whether or not an NFL team can thrive in a foreign market. The NFL wants a team in Europe; there is no doubt about that. They also don’t want to take a team out of America.

The NFL has publically commentated on the idea of adding new franchises. They have made it perfectly clear that if there is to be a team in a new market, in the United States or internationally, it is going to be an expansion team, rather than the relocation destination of a current one. The NFL has 32 teams, meaning that if they add another one in (for argument’s sake) London, than they will have to add a 34th to keep balance. But is there ever going to be too much?

Historically, those things that grow too big to control end in a major collapse. When you think of things of historical significance that fell at some point, whether it be the Chinese Dynasties, the Roman Empire, or the British Empire (just to name a few), they all followed this pattern. Make no mistake about it—we are currently what can be deemed the NFL Empire. The National Football League is by far the most profitable league in the entire world, out-earning Major League Baseball by over $1 billion. Four of the top five most profitable leagues are major North American sports (football, basketball, baseball, and hockey), and the NFL reigns supreme in North America.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every summer is documented by an anthem or "summer jam" that can bring back memories from any given year within seconds of the song being played. In 2012, this was Carly Rae Jepsen's debut hit, "Call me Maybe".  We can remember moments from the summer of 2013 by just hearing Robin Thicke repeat, "Hey Hey Hey" from his hit single, "Blurred Lines".  Last summer's memories can be described by Pharell in one word, "Happy". So what songs will define the summer of 2015?

Here is 10 songs that will guarentee good memories and sponser nostalgia when hearing them in those sad moments once summer is over!

1. Hold My Hand- Jess Glynne

2.Lean On- Major Lazer (feat. Mo &amp; DJ Snake)

3. This Summer's Gonna Hurt Like A...- Maroon 5

4. I Really Like You- Carly Rae Jepsen

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We all know YouTube as that website you go to to watch Beyoncé’s latest music video or a forty-five minute compilation of cat fails, but since it’s beginning in 2005, the video sharing website has exploded in to so much more. There are currently 1,311 YouTube channels that have over one million subscribers, with the most subscribed channel having 36 million. As an avid YouTube user and creator since 2009, I have seen so much change in this online community and expansion into the mainstream media. For example, Grace Helbig, has become one of the most successful YouTubers, not for having nearly 40 million subscribers, but because how she has started bringing YouTube-like content to mainstream television across the globe. 

	Current thirty year old, Grace Helbig, started making YouTube videos in 2008 and since then has only excelled in her entertainment career path. Just this year she created a comedy talk show starring herself titled, The Grace Helbig Show, which was quickly picked up by E! network and aired in April of 2015. She is the first YouTuber to have her own network television show and will probably open the doors to so many more to do the same. Her show is, “a hybrid comedy show that features the comedienne’s fresh take on what's trending in pop culture, as well as exclusive interviews with various celebrity guests” (eonline.com). I have found that adults who most commonly tune into E!’s late night shows are confused by the “YouTube vlogger” format of the show and find it somewhat childish and unintended for them. There is also the factor of her online comedic success coming from the enjoyment from younger audiences who don’t have the same sense of humor or relatable topics in social culture. E!  was clearly aware of the younger (13-18) audience they would gain from Helbig’s 2,500,000 subscriber base and tried to use that as a way to pull in more viewers, but with the show having a 10:30 EST time slot, most kids don’t tune in. Personally I have no urge to watch the show because of the already high level of accessibility of her content from her YouTube channel. In my opinion, although show has not gathered a large flock of viewers, the network made a, risky, smart decision by being the first to sign a YouTuber to a show because of how much more popular, accessible, and enjoyable the online culture has become.	

In conclusion, YouTube has opened up incredible opportunities throughout the entertainment world. I think that this joining of platforms will definitely take a while to settle as a, “community norm” to the current adults of our culture, but in the long run will become a really fun collaborative effort. A lot of my friends, and myself, factually watch YouTube more than T.V. all the time and I think that more people will start to catch this habit as our entertainment industry progresses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Visiting colleges can be an extremely awkward experience. College is a very important time in your life, and picking a college is a big decision. A key part in making this decision is visiting schools in order to determine what kind of school is right for you. Luckily, there are a wide variety of schools that offer an even wider variety of experiences. There is a school out there for everyone, no matter your passions and interests. The only struggle is finding the school that is best for you.

Going on college tours is certainly an experience, which can either be good or bad. You will go to a school and within the first few minutes know whether you like it or not. You will walk into some schools and love them instantly, and walk into others and know that you would never go there.

Fortunately, seeing the colleges that you dislike will give you clarity about the ones you do like. Tours on every campus, however, whether you decide that you like the school or not, can be awkward. Tour guides are given a big responsibility in showing off their school to a large group of people, and this doesn’t always go over well. Sometimes the tour guide isn’t loud enough or the people on the tour aren’t receptive enough; a lot can go wrong. And, often, these tours are what really draw you to or away from a school. The experience you have on a tour has a large effect on you, so in general it is important that these go well.

There are certain things tour guides will definitely, and should, tell you. You should be made aware of the rigor of the academics, the requirements, and the overall course of your academic career. They should go over basic information like the types of courses offered, the average class size, the student-to-faculty ratio, and when you declare your major. They generally also inform you of what student life is like both on and off campus. The percentage of students that live on campus and what the area is like around the school tend to greatly shape the way social life at that school works, so it is important to take note of the area around it and see if you could see yourself enjoying life there. Your tour guide should also inform you of any major opportunities that the school offers, such as study abroad programs, research opportunities, internships, sports, theater, and clubs. You’ll hear about tour guides taking people to the wrong location, running into college students doing things they shouldn’t have been doing, and talking about inappropriate subjects, and it is important to realize that every single thing your tour guide says and does is a reflection of the school: good or bad, these things are worth hearing and noting.

That being said, a few key things come into play on a college tour. First of all, you yourself have to be open to the experience, as do the people you are with. If you walk into a school with a closed mind, you won’t get very far. It is also important to take advantage of this opportunity. Learn more about the school, life on and off campus, and ask questions—the tour guide doesn’t have enough time to cover everything, but they do know what it’s like first hand to be a student at the school. Pay attention to the kind of people you see, whether they seem happy or not, and try to decide whether you could see yourself at the school.

&nbsp;

10 Things Tour Guides Shouldn’t Say:

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>“I hate my roommate.” - No one wants to hear this, especially when they’re already stressed out enough about finding people to be friends with.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>“All we do here is work.” - Work is great, but I’m pretty sure there’s much more to experience in college than just work.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>“If you don’t join a sorority you probably won’t have many friends.” - Sororities are great, but not for everyone.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>“My boyfriend slept in my room last night, so I’m hoping he won’t still be there when we tour my dorm.” - This is just too much information. Way too much information.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>“I’m actually leaving after this year because I don’t like it here.” - This is never, ever, a good thing to say while giving a tour. It automatically makes the people on it feel both uncomfortable and worried that they’d end up feeling the same way.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>“I had a different school as my top choice, but I didn’t get in so I came here.” - This makes it seem as if the school isn’t that great since it was the tour guide’s second choice. Of course, this could be the reality for many tour guides; however, that isn’t something they should be sharing. They should be trying to sell the school, and emphasizing all of the good things about it.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>“The food is pretty bad.” - This isn’t a deal breaker; however, it is important that the food on campus is good.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>“The dorm rooms are really small and the bathrooms are disgusting.” Considering that the people on the tour are thinking of spending the next four years of their lives in one of those dorms, this is not the best thing to say. (However, it does give everyone a warning for what they could end up being stuck with.)</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>“Not everyone here is very nice, but I have a couple of good friends.” - It’s obvious that anywhere you go there will be people that aren’t nice. There is no need to say this on a tour.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>“I’m really excited to go home soon!” - Seeing family and friends is great, however, when a tour guide says this it makes it seem as if they are eager to get out of there… which is not exactly a good thing.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

10 Things People On Tours Shouldn’t Do:
<ol>
	<li>Let parents control the tour. - Students should walk in front of their parents and ask questions if they feel the need to; the parents should take a step back since, well, they’re not the ones actually going to college.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Ask too many questions. - It is good to ask some questions and show interest, however, asking too many questions just gets annoying and overwhelming.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Talk too much. - If you are on a tour it is important to respect the tour guide and the school.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Wander around. - Don’t stray from the tour! It is important to follow the tour guide and stay on track. If you have questions or want to see another area of the school just ask- tour guides are usually more than willing to show you around other spots on campus. If you’re planning on leaving the tour early, you should probably notify the tour guide at the beginning of the tour. Leaving randomly is both awkward and impolite… and you don’t want to get lost.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Talk on the phone, or use a phone in general. - It’s rude. Speaking on the phone disrupts the tour guide and all of the other people on the tour. Looking at your phone is rude as well: you should be paying attention to the tour guide and your surroundings. You don’t want to miss anything!</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Complain. - If you’re tired, want to see something specific, or can’t hear, don’t complain. Tour guides are always willing to help you, so if you want to speak to them about something ask them politely.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Arrive late. - Arriving late to a tour is both unprofessional and awkward. It is important that you actually arrive around 10 minutes before your tour starts, as there is a sign in process and often somewhere else you have to go to meet your tour guide.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Wear heels or other uncomfortable shoes. - Though you are supposed to dress somewhat nicely for a tour, make sure you’re wearing comfortable shoes. Tours often require a lot of walking all around a campus. Tours generally take around an hour, unless you go to an information session which adds on another hour. The hour spent on the tour consists of a lot of walking that can be up and down hills and actually quite tiring.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Take too many photos or videos. - As previously stated, it is rude to use your phone during a tour. Taking pictures is okay, but only in moderation. Do not take pictures or videotape your tour guide, especially without their permission. If you see a spot on campus that you really want to remember, it is okay to snap a picture of that, but otherwise photo taking should be kept to a minimum. You do not want to seem like paparazzi.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Be afraid. - Do not be afraid to ask the tour guide questions. Though some topics should definitely be avoided while on a tour, your tour guide is there as a resource for you and can answer and questions and address any concerns you may have. Take advantage of this opportunity to learn more about a school through a student, as no one can better describe the experience than a student currently living it.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Kindle Fire</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On September 28th, Amazon shocked the tech world with the announcement of their newest Kindle. Their new “Kindle Fire” is a tablet with a 7 inch multitouch display, with a higher resolution than the iPad. It has a dual core CPU, wifi capability, and runs a very custom version of Google’s Android tablet operating system, Honeycomb. With access to Amazon’s huge library of content, including books, magazines, TV shows, music, and movies, this device will be killer for content consumption. It is also able to download applications and games from Amazon’s new app store and browse the web with Amazon’s Silk browser. Did I mention that it only cost $199?<!--more-->

Although the Kindle Fire does not match the iPad’s features, at $199 it will be a huge seller for Amazon. Not only has Amazon managed to come up with a tablet that is cheaper than the iPad, but they are the first company competing with Apple that has actually came up with something new, not just another wanna-be iPad.

We got our first glimpse of the iPad when it was first announced in January of 2010, at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco. Steve Jobs showed off its most prominent features and capabilities at the keynote announcement. We saw the iPad compose emails, create documents in the iWork suite, and later, when garageband was announced, we saw the iPad making music. In addition to being a great tool for content consumption, the iPad was touted as a creator, something that you could easily use instead of a laptop or personal computer. The Kindle Fire is completely different.

Our first view of the new Kindle in action was during its announcement event. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, gave the audience a demo of the new product. He showed us that the new Kindle can read books, watch videos, play music, and even play games downloaded from their app store. It was briefly mentioned that the Kindle Fire would have an email client, but it was not even demonstrated. It is quite obvious that the direction Amazon is going with their Kindle Fire is quite different from the one that Apple took. Unlike the iPad, the Kindle Fire was designed purely for consuming content. This is made even more obvious by the fact that it costs Amazon $10 more to manufacture the Kindle Fire than the price they are selling it for. So if they aren’t making money off of it, than why do they bother? The Kindle Fire (like previous Kindles) is simply a gateway for Amazon to reach more potential customers. Now, instead of just selling books with through their Kindles, they can now sell video, music, and apps, and the fact that all of this content is so easily accessible only makes the tablet more appealing.

So… Do I think the Kindle Fire will be a huge success? Absolutely. Do I think it will be an iPad killer? Not at all. The Kindle Fire will certainly cut into the iPad’s sales a little, but I think each device has its own, completely different market. I think that <a title="Shawn Blanc" href="http://shawnblanc.net/2011/09/the-kindle-fire/" target="_blank">Shawn Blanc</a> hit the nail on the head when he wrote “The Kindle Fire is a portable media center, not a portable computer”.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While its appearance is that of a gargantuan stationary hamster ball, the Virtusphere’s capabilities far exceed those of any pet toy, and any human toy for that matter. Gamers are equipped with virtual reality goggles and placed inside the Virtusphere. Once inside, they are free to “walk” in any direction and able to “see” where they are going. The ability of the ball to rotate in any direction allows gamers to walk and look anywhere they want, allowing complete and total freedom in the virtual environment. Its capabilities, while perfect for video games, are also marketed towards other sectors such as museums, architects, and the military. Museums can use them as virtual exhibits, architects can be given a three-dimensional look at their blueprints, and the military uses it to train soldiers more realistically.<!--more-->

Despite its potential for creating the most awesome gaming experience ever, there are some drawbacks. For example, many people reported that getting used to moving around in the Virtusphere was difficult, making inexperienced users feel awkward and off balance. In terms of price, the Virtusphere is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, cost remains its biggest obstacle to widespread use. Few people are willing to lay out upwards of $50,000 for a video game accessory. So while the Virtusphere is not likely to be installed in someone’s living room or the FA social space, the government and other large organizations have found the contraption to be quite useful.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year I began working on an iPhone app. It was pretty basic at first, in fact, it only had two buttons. The app contained two images, one of my A week schedule and one of my B week schedule, and the buttons I mentioned before simply switched between the two images. Since then the app has evolved. Now, the Friends Academy “Block” schedule is hardcoded into the app. This means that FA students who download the app can specify which class they have for each block as well as their lunch period, and the app will instantly generate a digital version of their schedule. The app even senses what time it is, and throughout the day shows you your current class, tells you what your next class is, and displays a progress bar that shows how far into each class you are. To give you a better idea of how this all works, here are some screenshots.

[gallery link="file" order="DESC"]
<!--more-->
A lot of thought and hard work has gone into making this app functional and fast, and I am happy to say that it is now available in the App Store: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faschedule/id472827413?mt=8" target="_blank">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faschedule/id472827413?mt=8</a>

If you like using this app, please check out <a href="http://applausecode.com/">Applause Code</a>, an app development company that I started with my dad and brother. We are hoping to release a bunch of apps throughout the year, and currently have a game called "Drop!" for sale in the App Store.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During the weekend of December 1<sup>st</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup>, the Americana Manhasset and Wheatley Plaza shopping centers are hosting the 16<sup>th</sup> annual “Champions for Charity” event. There are 90 non-profit organizations that benefit from this fundraiser, including Friends Academy’s own Diversity Grant Fund. Members of the FA community, along with the general public, can participate by registering for a special Champion Card to use at the event. The Diversity Club respectfully requests that people select its Grant Fund as their charity of choice. Twenty-five percent of the money spent will go to this worthy cause, and any sized contribution is greatly appreciated.<!--more-->

The Diversity Grant Fund has been extremely successful in distributing financial aid to members of the school who apply for monetary assistance for expenses that include “art supplies, AP tests, calculators, musical instruments and Driver's Education,” said Sophie Fritz ’12, the President of the Diversity Committee. Requests are anonymous and never denied. The fund supports the Diversity Club’s idea of equal opportunity for all. By creating this financial resource, the Club is making progress in preventing the exclusion of those who cannot afford certain necessities of an FA student.

&nbsp;

The “Champions for Charity” weekend is an event that many meaningful organizations greatly profit from. Please consider participating and share information about it with friends and family!

To register, please click this link:

For further inquiries regarding applications to receive aid from the Diversity Grant Fund, please contact Mrs. Clark.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week’s fashion website: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://shopbop.com">shopbop.com</a></span></strong> <strong></strong>

Many FA students, including myself, go on shopbop.com in the hopes of finding a new dress, jacket, and maybe even a pair of boots… But do any of us really know how to use it?

Category labels line the top of the website and indicate where you can find the specific items you’re looking for. But, what if you are just browsing and aren’t sure what you want? What is the <strong>fastest, simplest</strong> way to find a fun new look?<!--more-->

While bored on my computer one day, I went onto shopbop, and clicked the clothing label. I had no look in mind; rather I needed an outlet to forget about the stressful day ahead. I felt overwhelmed by the amount of choices that lay in front of me. After a good twenty minutes of scrolling up and down the website, I came across the label called <strong>Lookbooks</strong>. This tab opened up a whole new world for me of online shopping; a world that takes up hardly any time and is virtually stress-free.

Lookbooks contain pictures of the latest fashion trends, on and off the runway. It even shows you different ways to wear certain pieces; this gives you the ability to find a cute, trendy and fantastic outfit in less than five minutes! Multiple consumers and designers make Lookbooks; therefore, there are a variety of styles and ideas giving an option to almost anyone!

So, when you’re stressing about schoolwork and need to take a break, go to shopbop.com and click on Lookbooks. I guarantee you find a look you’ll love; and in under five minutes!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Trends of Fall and Spring</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2011/10/29/trends-of-fall-and-spring/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fall 2011 is here, and it is time for girls to get shopping. Fashion week in Paris and New York is always a good indicator of what people will be wearing around town (and campus) these days. This season, fashion week set some major trends in outerwear, and fabrics for fall, as well as patterns and themes for spring. In addition we learned that colors don’t have to be neutral, and some long standing fashion rules can finally be broken.<!--more-->

For fall:

For outerwear, Capes and Ponchos are definitely in. Anything goes, from tailored to bohemian. If you want to stick to the more traditional jacket, a military jacket or a varsity style are the looks of the moment.

Finally, FA girls will be stylish while staying in code, as long hemlines are in for fall. Miniskirts are being replaced with knee length skirts and the styles are classic or bohemian.

As for colors, no need to stick with traditional fall neutrals. Designers are showing that fall clothing can be colorful, and Polka dots and dainty prints are no longer reserved for spring. In the past nobody would have dreamed of white after Labor Day, and now the top designers are sending white down their runways.

Most likely inspired by the royal wedding, hats are making a comeback this fall. This trend is very versatile, as anything goes, from a military to a floppy to a fedora. If you are too self consciousness to make this kind of statement, you can get a furry hat, or cap that covers you ears, making you look both fashionable and practical.

For spring: (if you are interested in getting a little head start on your shopping)

Marc Jacob’s spring collection accented loafers this year. FA girls stick to flats for the most part, so if you want to be original, and take a fashion risk, loafers are a good start.

Just like the fall, bold colors are staying in for spring. This trend was especially used in the lines of Milly and Nanette Lepore. As for patterns, nautical is a big one. This pattern is a horizontal blue and white stripe, which looks great on a sweater or bag.

Last but not least, a bowler bag for this spring is a must. Not only has it been used in almost all of the runway shows, but this style bag is being carried by almost all of the celebs. These bags are roomy and light, perfect for a day in the city or even just a walk around town.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The FA Cross Country team has enjoyed a lot of success this season.  Both teams, boys and girls, are in first place in their respective divisions and the majority of members from each team set new personal bests.  In addition to these personal accolades, the teams has really seemed to bond as a group. The season was highlighted by a trip to Brown for the top seven boys and girls on each team.

Both teams won the Class C Championship! This victory was followed by a 5+ hour bus ride at 7am on Friday up to the state meet in Utaca, NY. On Saturday the two teams went to Vernon-Verona Sherill High school with about 100 other runners from Nassau County for the race. In their races, the FA runners put up a good fight as they battled about 150 other runners in the State, and had to endure a grueling 3 miles of battling cold, hills, and LOTS AND LOTS of mud! The boys team finished 8th in the state and the girls team finished 7th. Our very own Kelsey Margey, 12,  took the bronze medal home!

Top seven girls: Kelsey Margey, Katrina Garry,  Molly Sullivan, Sunny Lostritto, Katie Pappas, Rosie Mangiarotti, Emily LeoGrande

Top seven Boys: Glenn Lostritto, Patrick Crowley, Sahil Massand, Evan Sayre, Rob Adams, John O'Brien, Will Duke

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ariana: agree with trina, i think you should maybe add few sentences about a transition type of clothing to go from winter to spring (?)</strong>

<strong>trinas note: i think we are wayyy past winter :( think this is hitting the trash</strong>

<strong>victoria wang: fixed some minor typos, needs photos. can we do something with the fonts and sizes of certain words, like they do in magazines? this short paragraph seems a little bland and my eyes skimmed right past everything.</strong>

<strong>Melissa Greenblatt: this is very true to blogging so i think it is alright, just needs some photos; but definitely would be cool if changing font is an option</strong>

Although stores are already geared up for spring, it is never too late to buy a knit sweater or a new cardigan. Down vests as well as chunky knits are in for the rest of winter and fashion experts predict that they will stay in season for fall and winter of 2013. So if you recently bought a wrap sweater that you love but feel like you won't get much use out of it this season, don’t worry, it will definitely not go out of style.]]></content:encoded>

Spring time is here and so are your allergies! This spring 2012 allergy season is said by researches to be the worst ever, but why is this so?  A study published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the length of ragweed season in various areas of the U.S. increased by as much as 27 days between 1995 and 2009. Are the different lengths of ragweed the culprit? Instead, researchers say climate change is the reason for such a powerful coming allergy season. Because of the unusually warm weather this winter, the allergy season has come early this year and “hit with a wheezing vengeance!” 

According to Doctor Stanley Fineman, president-elect of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and an allergist at the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic, "The seasons are getting longer—they're starting earlier and pollens are getting released earlier." Not only is weather the problem, but CO2, or carbon dioxide percentage is high in the air. It feeds plants and leads to a greater release of pollen, and sometimes that pollen is more potent and more allergenic than it was when there was less CO2 in the atmosphere.
So, the real question is…how can we avoid experiencing all the sneezing, runny noses, congestion, itching, etc.? 

Here are some suggested solutions: 
1.	Know what triggers your allergies. You may not be experiencing symptoms from pollen and the air around you, but some factors could be mold or fungus, which are exacerbated by April showers 
2.	Keep your windows shut and try to stay inside on dry days. Once you have located you’re the trigger to your symptoms it is best that you avoid them in any way possible
3.	Rid all kitchen chemicals. Household cleaning items can aggravate or even cause both indoor and outdoor allergies. 
a.	Triclosan, the active ingredient in antibacterial soaps, has been tested to be the cause of many indoor allergy sufferers. 
4.	Watch what you eat. Your body’s immune system can identify a similarity between the proteins of pollen and the proteins of fruit. When your allergies are at its worst it is best to eat leafy greens. 
“Climate chaos is hammering for your health!” So try your best to do right for your body so that this allergy season can be a little less sneezy!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>KG: ready for pub</strong>

Being the Co-State Championships of last year, its evident that Friends Academy's girl's soccer team does not disappoint. This year is no exception! Losing very few seniors from last year the girls entered the 2012 season strong and ready to make it states again, and based on their record they will do exactly that. With an exciting win over Cold Spring Harbor last week and then a back to back win over Locust Valley the girls have got a pep in their step, or should we say kick!

Led by Senior captains Jess Babicz, Krystina Iordanou, Marissa Tidona, and Heather Maierle the team is planning to have an incredible end to the season!

Good luck girls!

Highlights of the game with Cold Spring Harbor  were captured below by Freshman Inkwell Photographer Owen Collier.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“…Reading is by far the most satisfying distraction of all, and it actually makes you smarter. Read anything -- just read!” Out of all people in Friends Academy, who do you think would say this sentence any better than an English teacher? To be more specific, Doctor Garrett. Dr. Shawn Marie Garrett is a new teacher to the English department this year, teaching a ninth grade course and American Perspectives for a section of the eleventh grade. Dr. Garrett’s teaching career began in 1990 in Europe, where she started teaching English as a second language. Before entering the Friends Academy staff, Doctor Garrett taught at the university level, “most recently in the Writing and Rhetoric Program at Stony Brook University (2010-2012) and, before that, at Barnard College, Columbia University (1999-2010).”

I asked Dr. Garrett, to explain the “aha” moment when she realized that she wanted to become an English teacher. She distinctly said that “teaching is in her blood”. It is her “dharma", meaning that she was born to teach, specifically English. Garrett’s childhood “play school” moments with her friends and her family’s teaching history are two components that have inspired Doctor Garrett to pursue a career as an English teacher. Dr. Garret is “thrilled to be here”, at Friends Academy, and hopes “to inspire in her students curiosity, a love of reading, writing, and thinking, and an excitement for tackling things that are hard.” She hopes to embrace the Quaker tradition and continue to educate herself with this community. Welcome Doctor Garrett to the Friends Academy. We are looking for a great year with you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>katrina: agree with victoria that it was his mothers classroom is not true.. check CNN his mother was found dead at his house and has no relation to the school in any way. also the shortness of this article is a little tricky... maybe find something else to focus on about how we can support the students of sandy hook? security obviously is something that came out of the tragedy but as a Quaker school it also in our mission to hold those who were lost in the horrific accident in the light.</strong>

<strong>edits by victoria: please recheck your sources or cite which article you found tha tstated that adam lanza walked into his mother's classroom. </strong>

<strong>numbers less than 100 should be written out in full so not 9 but nine. remember to put the station after the full name, i.e Elizabeth Phillips, head of English department, and the grade after the full name, i.e Will Duke, senior. also, has the near future faculty meeting happened yet? as it is now, this article is a little outdated, so maybe get updates on specifics and another quote on how FA safety discussions have progressed since december.</strong>

On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza walked into his mother’s, Nancy Lanza, classroom at around 9:30 in the morning. Armed with his mother’s assault rifle, he shot and killed 27 people including his mother, twenty elementary students between the ages of six and eight, and himself. This event greatly impacted the country, especially its schools. The question is - how does it affect the members of Friends Academy?

Bill Morris informed us that the faculty will meet in the near future to discuss what safety measures will be taken at Friends. According to Mr. Morris, “We are going to do a review of what we currently have in place and try to determine how that is working and whether we need to enhance it in any way.”

He expressed the community's intent to take action and discuss this issue with the local police departments on the best way to protect the students. For now, Mr. Morris is trying to evaluate the best plan moving forward, but after interviewing several students, all have said that they overall feel safe at Friends. According to Caroline Sgaglione, “I do feel safe; I do not think anyone at this school would have any reason to do anything, but maybe we could have some more security.” Thus far, Friends Academy has been a safe place for its students, and there is no reason that this should change. But after what has occurred at Sandy Hook it might be wise to have visible security as an extra precaution.]]></content:encoded>

Originating in the heart of Australia, these sheepskin boots were first created for the sole purpose to warm surfers toes while on the beach, waiting for their next run. In 1978, Brian Smith brought these sheepskin boots to Southern California with much hope that these boots would soon become an upcoming sensation, therefore founding this worldwide company and trend throughout the world, “UGG”. Ever since then, UGG’s have not only made an appearance in a teenage girls day to day life, yet have also appeared on many television shows and movies, such as Paris Hitlton’s “It-girl”. These comfortable, yet stylish shoes can be seen sported by girls and boys 1 to 100 years old all over the world!

Doc Martens were initially invented after a foot injury occurred due to skiing. This injury “prompted” Dr. Maertens to develop a comfortable air-cushioned sole. After spotting this boot in a magazine, UK shoemaker Bill Griggs decided to remarket these shoes, calling them “Dr Martens”(Doc Martens), after Dr. Maertens himself. This boot made its first major appearance when The Who guitarist, Pete Townshend, wore them on tour claiming to have only two things when going to bed, “A cognac and a Dr. Martens boot”. Doc Martens soon became known as the boot choice for “rebellious youth culture”. Since their introduction in 1950, Doc Martens have only continued to grow in style and continue to make appearances in countries all over the world.

The word “kimono” is Japanese for clothing. The classic kimono started being worn during the Heian period (794-1192).  Back in these days, kimonos were worn everywhere around Japan, by both men and women. However, lots of change has happened since these days. Kimonos are now referred to specifically as “traditional Japanese clothing” around Japan, only worn on special occasions such as weddings, tea ceremonies, funerals, and festivals, but not in everyday life (like they used to be). Coming in all different colors, textures, and patterns, kimonos soon began selling in countries all over the world, becoming very popular and trendy for both young girls and adults.

The boat shoe, also known as top-sider or the deck shoe, has gone through many edits since the initial model. Originally worn by men as work and utility wear, these shoes have now become worn by both men and women, for all types of purposes. In the 1930’s, this famous boat shoe was created by Paul Sperry, a sailor and boater. Receiving inspiration from his cocker spaniel, Prince’s, amazing grip while walking on ice, Sperry believed that a shoe should be created to have this type of grip, yet be supportable and comfortable. Sperry examined Prince’s feet, and then cut out similar patterns on the soles of the shoes he used while boating. In 1980, Lisa Birnbach published “The Official Preppy Handbook”, which identified boat shoes as a staple to the preppy style. However, boat shoes have been adapted all over the world, coming in an array of different colors and patterns and worn year round in several variations of style.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This year's fall show is about leaves a lot up to the imagination. Written and directed by Andrew Geha, The Right Now, premiers next Thursday night, October 6th at 7pm. There is a matinee on Friday the 7th for the upper school, followed by evening performances on Friday and Saturday nights at 7pm. Many community members have asked and wondered, "what is this show about?". Well, I can not say much, except that this particular production is unlike any other show that has been put on at Friends Academy. It is full of excitement, and unexpected twists and turns along the way. Starring Julia Newitt and Alex Nagel, this show is not one you want to miss. Despite it's mysterious concept and plot line, the team behind the production has been rehearsing, building and planning for months to put on this production.

All that most community members know about the show is the set that has visibly developed on the upper school stage for the past few weeks. There have been all sorts of theories as to what exactly could happen in this show, but to find out students and faculty will have to wait and see. The cast and crew have kept the story quiet, but why? What is it about this show that requires so much secrecy? To spark some theories read the prompt below, from the US Theater Season email sent out in late August, and comment what you think the show could possibly be about.

"You know that familiar feeling you get on Monday mornings as you head to school? That feeling like you’ve done it before? Is it just the repetition? Is it déjà vu? Or is it… something else?"]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>THE ROAD TO BURLINGTON</b></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>BY ELISSA FIELDING</b></p>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>*THE TRIP TO BURLINGTON* </b>

On April 4th, 2015, was my day of departure to Burlington, Vermont, and was also my first day of Spring Break (not including April 3rd, which was Good Friday). I woke-up early first thing in the morning around 6:00a.m because the AMTRAK train at Pennsylvania Station would be departing at 11:30a.m. Plus, my mother and I didn’t take a train to the city. Instead, we had my father drive us to Pennsylvania Station, despite the unbearable New York City traffic back-ups.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

An hour later (somewhere around 9:40a.m), my mom and I grabbed our luggage out of the car off of 31st street &amp; 7th avenue, and headed inside the AMTRAK center to wait for our train to be called. While we were waiting, we decided to get some food since we didn’t have a proper breakfast, so we went to a cafe &amp; bar restaurant, where they serve the most <b><i>amazing </i></b>grilled chicken sandwiches ever on planet Earth! After we were done eating, we hauled our luggage back to the waiting area and our train was called on the loudspeaker. Our train, the “Vermonter”, was on time and was on TRACK #54, so we hurried down to the track as quickly as we could through the large crowd of people who also needed to catch <i>their </i>trains in a hurry. Once we got on the train, the train immediately departed and we were ready for a nine hour non-stop trip to Burlington, Vermont.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

While on the train ride to Burlington, Vermont, I decided to take the opportunity to take a couple of photographs of the vast landscapes and buildings that I passed by on my way to my ending destination:

The first picture is an abandoned factory in Bridgeport, CT. The second picture is a park/baseball fields at Wards Island, NY. The third picture is a lake in Windsor Locks, CT, and the fourth picture is a large mountain/hill in South Royalton, Royalton, VT.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<b>*FIRST DAY*</b>

On April 5th, 2015, was my first day into Spring Break for my vacation in Burlington, Vermont. I woke-up to the fresh scent of a new room because the hotel that I stayed at (Homewood Suites by Hilton: 5 Dorset Street, South Burlington, VT, 05404) was finished being built 2 weeks ago. For breakfast I had eggs, turkey sausage, pastries and orange juice, while my mom had eggs whites and steaming hot green tea. The pastries that <i>I </i>had were heaven on Earth! (picture is to the right). After breakfast was over, my mom and I decided to do our own little adventure, so we went out to explore Burlington and its “unknown” territory. First, we went to Lake Champlain, which lies between the border of New York and Vermont. The lake was frozen at the time, so no ships were sailing. Legend has it that Lake Champlain is one of Vermont’s most dangerous lakes. Back in the day (1800s), steamboats and ships would be pushed to the limit from the horrid weather conditions and crash into the rocky shore---very few lives were spared. Anyway, after we were done basking in the glory of the beauteous frozen surface of Lake Champlain, my mom and I started to become hungry and thirsty, so we went down to Downtown Burlington to see what restaurants they had available---they had a lot! One of the restaurants that we went to was called “The Farm House--Tap &amp; Grill”(160 Bank Street, Burlington, VT 05401).  Apparently, the restaurant was hip and trendy, so was the rest of Burlington! There were college students in every corner of the restaurant, including the workers, because the University of Vermont <b><i>is </i></b>in Burlington (South Burlington). Anyway, my mom ordered two plates of organic salad and I ordered a popular dish in the restaurant called “Hot Pastrami”---it was amazing! Next, we went shopping through the “main hub” of Burlington on Church Street. An hour or two later of shopping, it was time for dinner, so we went out to this ship-theme restaurant/steakhouse called “The Windjammer” (1076 Williston Road, Windjammer Hospitality Group, South Burlington, VT 05403).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<b>*SECOND DAY*</b>

On April 6th, 2015, was my second day into Spring Break for my vacation in Burlington, Vermont. There wasn’t much to do because my mom and I did so much exploring the day before, so this was a day of relaxation and a day of hanging out with the local college students. For breakfast, my mom and I went to the lobby of the hotel, and we had the same thing to eat that we had the day before. For lunch, my mom and I decided to get out to get some fresh air, so went to <i>another </i>popular restaurant that college students like to go to called “The Skinny Pancake”. At the restaurant, I ordered an delicious dish called the “Blue Beet Panini”, which was their special for the day, with a side of sweet potato fries (I forgot to take a photograph of the fries). Then, once we finished eating lunch, we went next door to a store called “Peace &amp; Justice”, where they sell political merchandise and handmade items from around the world. While in the shop, I bought myself a “I Love Earth” bag. \(*^_^*)/

“Blue Beet Panini” with a pickle and salad that I didn’t eat (I gave it to my mom because I know she <i>loves </i>pickles and salads).

The restaurant had a stage, where they show daily performances.

This is my “I Love Earth” bag. Very cute and environment at the same time.

<b>*THIRD DAY*</b>

On April 7th, 2015, was the third day into Spring Break for my vacation in Burlington, Vermont. For breakfast, my mom and I went downstairs, and ate the breakfast that the hotel had available in their lobby. After breakfast, we decided to go out shopping for ourselves, but I decided to buy gifts for my teachers, so I bought them homemade jam that was made in the local farms in Vermont---yummy!! Once we were done buying jam, our stomachs became hungry yet our minds were thirsty for exploration, so we drove out of Burlington, VT, to Shelburne, VT, to have lunch at Olive Garden (1025 Shelburne Rd, South Burlington, VT 05403). While there, I ordered the “Classic Calamari” and “Cheese Ravioli”---they both were to <b><i>die </i></b>for!!

The salad came first.

The “Classic Calamari” came second. Poor squid….

My “Cheese Ravioli” came last---finally! What took so long?!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<b>*FOURTH DAY*</b>

On April 8th, 2015, was the fourth day into Spring Break for my vacation in Burlington, Vermont. For breakfast, we had the same thing as yesterday: eggs, turkey sausage, apple juice/orange juice and pastries. Then, my mom and I went back to our hotel room to relax for an hour or two, until we got bored, so we went out to Church Street for lunch. A french bistro called “Leunig’s Bistro”(115 Church Street, Burlington, VT, 05455) caught our eyes, so we went inside. Inside, the co-owner of the restaurant, Bob Conlon, was in a jovial mood, so he decided to show us to our table, which was very nice of him. We sat down and read ours menus, trying to decide <i>what </i>to have for lunch. Then, our waiter, who was a college student, came and asked us what we wanted. He asked me first, so I told him that I wanted the sweet potato fries for an appetizer---he said “delicious” in a manly voice or whatever (he <i>actually </i>thought I was a college student too, so did everyone else, and I thought he was flirting with me ^_^)---then, I told him that I wanted the grilled chicken sandwich as the main dish. Since he was so nice, he decided to save us money by putting the sweet potato fries with the grilled chicken sandwich for a less price---what a <i>sweet </i>deal! Faster than lightning, our food came, steaming and fresh out the kitchen. Once done eating, we were about to leave the restaurant, until the co-owner decided to give me a knickknack as a gift---it was a booklet of matches. I had no use for the matches, but it was a generous gift. Gosh, vermonters are so friendly! After lunch, my mom and I went to a local Ben &amp; Jerry’s Ice Cream Shoppe, where I had a large vanilla ice cream cup and my mom had a small mango ice cream cup. Once the ice cream was sitting gently in our stomachs, we decided to go meet a local business owner in one of the shops on Church Street, so we went to a homemade leather-making business called “Champlain Leather”. The co-owner, Nancy, was a <i>very </i>nice lady---especially, her two dogs, Bella &amp; Coco---they were too cute for words!! Here’s a heartwarming quote from the co-owner, Nancy:  <i>“What I love about Burlington is the night sky. That’s why I love.”</i>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<b>*FIFTH DAY*</b>

On April 9th, 2015, was my fifth day into Spring Break for my vacation in Burlington, Vermont. For breakfast, we had the same thing from the day before. An hour or two later, we decided to eat lunch, so we went all the way to Shelburne, VT, (not <i>too </i>far from Burlington) to eat at a trendy restaurant that all the college students go to called “Rustic Roots”( 195 Falls Rd, Shelburne, VT, 05482-6209). At the restaurant, it was very cozy and I felt very welcomed. While at the restaurant, I ordered “Pastrami On Rye” (yes, I ate a lot of meat while on vacation), but I didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would because the mustard was <i>way </i>too spicy and <i>too </i>many pickles (I’m not much of a ‘pickle eater’). A couple minutes later, the waitress (a college student) asked whether we wanted to eat dessert or not---I bravely said “HELL YEA!” (well, not really. I just said “yes”). I ordered the “Nutella &amp; Banana” crepe---IT WAS TO DIE FOR!! With one bite....I entered nutella and banana heaven, and met the powdered sugar angels. After eating the “immortal dessert of all desserts”, I got a <i>really </i>bad stomach ache because my stomach was full, so I decided to take a walk to walk off the food. Nothing like eating a good yet heavy lunch, then getting some good exercise all at the same time :) Once it was time for dinner, my mom and I went to Church Street in Burlington, VT, and ate at an american bistro called “Sweetwaters”(120 Church Street, Burlington, VT 05401). I ordered a “Naked Burger”(a well-done burger with cheddar cheese) and some mussels with fries.

Fries on top of mussels? What a delectable masterpiece!

A “Naked Burger” with sweet potato fries AND ranch dip?! OMG!!

Inside “Sweetwaters” (We sat a table or two away from the bar)

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>*SIXTH DAY*</b>

On April 10th, 2015, was my sixth and final day into Spring Break for my vacation in Burlington, Vermont, so my mom and I went through this day as if it were our last. We traveled to the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, VT, where the whole property was owned and founded by Electra Havemeyer Webb, who was born on August 16th, 1888, and died on November 19th, 1960 (she’s tied to the Webb Family and the Vanderbilt Family). While at the museum, I took some <i>awesome </i>photographs of the vast surroundings, including a steamboat on land <i>not </i>water! After an hour of being on the premises, my mom and I decided to go to Lake Champlain one <i>last </i>time, before our departure tomorrow. The sun was lowering into the horizon, some of the light rays coming from the sun were shining through the cloudy sky and onto the glistening surface of the frozen reservoir, and all was quiet (well, except for the college students going to prom at the local aquarium). I enjoyed the rest of the night sleeping and dreaming of the good times I had. I sure do miss Burlington :’(

		<title>The Link Between Global Warming and Terrorism</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the U.N. hosting climate talks in Paris just last week, there has been been heated debate over whether or not world leaders should be so focused on the issue of global warming, with many other problems, such as the current Syrian refugee crisis and ISIS, appearing to be far more pressing. Many politicians have espoused such a view- most recently, Donald Trump, who questioned why Barack Obama is focusing on the environment when the threat of ISIS is growing each day. People like Donald Trump who make statements like this fail to understand what many security analysts, scientists, and government officials have known for decades: Global warming is undoubtably a factor in the rise of terrorism, and the connection between the two problems that our world is facing today means that we cannot possibly solve the resultant problem (terrorism) if we ignore the first (global warming).</p>

<p>When Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders used the terrorist attacks in Paris to call for action to address climate change, he attracted ridicule across the political spectrum. However, while many were quick to attack him for his statement, &ldquo;many academics and national security experts agree that climate change contributes to an uncertain world where terrorism can thrive.&rdquo; US military officials refer to this concept as a &ldquo;threat multiplier&rdquo;; climate change takes &ldquo;issues like terrorism that already pose a threat to national security and exacerbates the damage they can cause.&rdquo; (Worland) A 2014 Department of Defense Report further elaborates on how the damage from climate change can lead to global instability, the major factor in terrorism. Their report states that, &ldquo;rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels and extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict. They will likely lead to food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and destruction by natural disasters in regions across the globe.&rdquo; (DoD) With an increase in instability comes an increased risk for terrorism; So, because so much of global instability can be traced back to climate change, why are so many individuals failing to make the connection between global warming and terrorism?</p>

<p>No one has the answer to that. But, when you read and listen to people who actually understand the issues, like Pentagon analysts, Department of Defense experts, and even Bill Nye, it becomes apparent the real-world impact that global warming is having on our fight against terrorism right now. Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples.</p>

<p>The first country I&rsquo;m going to pinpoint is Nigeria. The country is threatened by both a devastating drought&nbsp; and violence from the terrorist group Boko Haram. At first glance, it doesn&rsquo;t seem credible that these two events are related. Yet, they are deeply intertwined, with Nigeria&rsquo;s worsening social and political situation being directly influenced by the state of the environment. The population explosion has burdened the land to the point that 35% of the land in Nigeria that was farmable 50 years ago is no longer arable. In addition, a major river, Lake Chad, has shrunk. Food and water shortages have led to increasing social instability, which Boko Haram used to their advantage to rise to power. When the government can no longer maintain stability within their country, it creates a vacuum where terrorist groups can emerge. In Nigeria, Boko Haram grows more powerful, while the environmental situation seems to be only getting worse.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/74690440_maid.jpg"><img alt="_74690440_maid" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4792" height="169" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/74690440_maid-300x169.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>A second country that is on everyone&rsquo;s minds right now is Syria. Millions of refugees are fleeing from the oppression and cruelty of ISIS, causing a strain on European resources and leading many people to question what the solution could possibly be. Furthermore, ISIS is wrecking havoc on the countries in the Middle East- Iraq, Iran, Syria- posing a massive international security threat. While the entire world is panicking about this crisis, few look to the origins of this crisis, and how some saw it brewing years ago. An article from the PNAS journal states that &ldquo;there is evidence that the 2007- 2010 drought contributed to the conflict in Syria. It was the worst drought in the instrumental record, causing widespread crop failure and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers.&rdquo; (Kelly) This mass migration led to widespread poverty within those urban centers, creating exactly the kind of social instability that fosters the motivation for terrorist groups to form. The drought, combined with Assad&rsquo;s totalitarian, oppressive regime, was a recipe for disaster, and disaster came: ISIS emerged as a credible threat to international security, wrecking havoc in the Middle East region and gaining enough traction to launch attacks overseas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMAGE635262552631870685.jpg"><img alt="IMAGE635262552631870685" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4794" height="192" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMAGE635262552631870685-300x192.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>These are just two examples of what climate change has influenced, in terms of the formation of terrorist groups. But it doesn&rsquo;t end there. If sea levels continue to rise at the same rate, within a number of decades (within our lifetimes!) low-lying islands like Kiribati and Fiji will be underwater. Picture the international conflict that the Syrian refugee crisis is causing... Now multiply that with the number of people who will be international refugees if their homes go underwater. The population of Kiribati and Fiji combined is approximately 1 million. That&rsquo;s 1 million people who will be looking for a new home. It&rsquo;s not a hypothetical situation; Current estimates are that the islands will be uninhabitable within the next 30-60 years. If we have a second refugee crisis on our hands, that creates a breeding ground for new terrorist groups to emerge out of the inevitable social instability. These problems aren&rsquo;t going to go away; they will continue to compound and get even more frightening than they are currently.</p>

<p>The issue is not that people don&rsquo;t care. Many, many people care. However, most think that one thing is more important than the other. We have our representatives in the government shouting at each other over whether climate change or ISIS (and the larger problem of terrorism) is more important. The answer to this? You may not believe that a mere high school junior has the answer to this problem, but here it is: They are both important. They do not exist without each other. In order to solve the problem of terrorism, you cannot look at the problem of terrorism alone. Terrorism doesn&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum; There are many different factors influencing it&rsquo;s rise and spread, and ignoring one of those factors just because it doesn&rsquo;t seem as important will have disastrous consequences. In order to solve an issue, we need to look at all sides of it. When it comes to solving the threat of terrorism, we need to analyze every aspect, and that includes the very real threat that climate change poses.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">During this brisk week in October, a clear transition into autumn at FA was contrasted by another transition in the Middle East. The latest expression of what is being called the “Arab Spring” went viral on the Internet. The killing of the notoriously cruel Libyan dictator, Mouammar Gaddafi, was broadcast to the entire world. Filmed and uploaded by a Libyan bystander, the video shows the former dictator being dragged out of a sewer pipe in his hometown of Sirte, where he was hiding in an attempt to avoid this gruesome fate. His death marks the end to a decades old brutal regime.<!--more--></p>
The interesting part is that despite the thousands of American troops that have been sent to the region by the United Nations, Gaddafi wasn’t captured and killed by American soldiers. He was violently beaten, tortured, and killed by his own people. Eyewitnesses said that Gaddafi was pleading for his life during his final moments, and that he was later shot by his bodyguard to put an end to his suffering. It was an ironic ending for such a greedy dictator, who was infamously unconcerned about the lives of others. Evidence shows that he apathetically starved, shot, and buried his own people in mass graves. Nevertheless, he lived a life of luxury in lavish palaces and homes, which have been captured on film in the past months after the people overran them. Impoverished Libyans sprawled across Gaddafi’s fancy couches was a memorable sight to many, featured in many news broadcasts around the world. Yet, Gaddafi did not let the people forget his power, for even when he was captured, he was carrying a gun made of pure gold.

Gaddafi was a man who for forty-two years ruled with violence, promoted violence, and allegedly supported Al Qaeda and Hamas (Al Qaeda and Hamas are terrorist organizations that routinely kill innocent civilians). In an effort to hold power, Gaddafi’s forces killed innocent Libyan civilians. Yet, the violent, brutal ending of a violent, brutal man was calmly uploaded onto the Web. The filming of his death was uploaded as casually as we post silly videos on You Tube.

Questions and thoughts unfold: is it acceptable for us as innocent bystanders to watch the senseless killing of another human being? Even though Gaddafi was a senseless, harsh man himself, should we treat him in the same way he treated us? Is it “<em>right</em>”? Either way, people genuinely love revenge. Understandably so, for the Libyans have every right to celebrate the death of their destructive Dictator. But maybe our Quaker community should showcase another key point. Let us not emulate Gaddafi by any means, let us not become a society where we go out and seek revenge, and let us not torture someone because he/she tortured others.

Although we should not try to emulate the behavior of both Mouammar Gaddafi and his avengers, the death of Gaddafi is a fantastic step forward for the ever-revolutionary Middle East. The Libyan people can now take the government into their own hands. Let us hope that Libya’s government evolves into one lacking a dictator, and one with sensible laws that promote equality, and peace.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Do You Know Where Your Dog Came From?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever seen an adorable puppy staring at you out of the window of a local pet store? Does he beg for your attention by pressing his little paws on the glass? Before you know it you are inside the store, and are mesmerized by the cute furry faces peering at you from their cages. All of a sudden you want to buy a puppy, and you are not alone.

According to the United States Humane Society, approximately 72.8 million people own dogs in the United States. Dog owners know everything about their dog, what time their dog goes to bed, what it likes to eat and what kind of shoes it likes to chew on.  However, many of them don’t know where their beloved pet was born. Owners, who buy their dogs from pet stores, are so captivated by the cute faces of these animals that they fail to consider the harm that occurs to the dogs in making them available for sale.  Ninety-nine percent of the furry companions we often see displayed in pet stores are products of puppy mills.<!--more-->

What is a puppy mill? A puppy mill is a facility where commercial breeders mass breed dogs to the point where it can become animal abuse. These breeders don’t care about the animals, they care about the profit. The dogs in puppy mills face terrible conditions. One facility may be home to hundreds or thousands of dogs, each confined to small, wire-floor cages where they are locked up for days and even years. No walks, no blankets, no toys, no love. Cages are often stacked one on top of the other, allowing feces to fall through to the animals below. Mothers are bred as soon as they are able and for as long as they physically can, and are often not provided with proper nutrition to sustain them during their pregnancies.  These animals are given the bare minimum, food and water.  Veterinary care is unheard of, cleanliness is often nonexistent and negligence is everywhere. A high percentage of puppies never live to see the pet store window, they die in the squalor they were born into.  Furthermore, if a breed suddenly goes out of style, the mothers are disposed of as quickly as possible using appalling methods such as drowning and shooting.  The lack of sufficient state inspectors leaves basic care requirements for breeders unenforced.

It stands to reason that any rational prospective puppy owner would not want to support the vicious cycle of the puppy mill. The puppies that make it to the pet store are adopted by owners who never know the misery their new puppy has faced.  Puppies from pet stores often come with papers, boasting pure pedigrees and reputable origins. The average buyer is so smitten with their newfound friend that they fail to carefully research the details of its breeding which are often obscured and in many instances, false.

So, what can we do to stop this cruelty once and for all? Spread awareness and resist the temptations of pet store windows and adopt one of the many puppies available in your local animal shelter.  Although many believe that the purchase of a pet store puppy saves a puppy from its miserable beginnings.  However, one must consider that the hefty prices paid for these animals ensure that more dogs will go down this path of misery.  Always check your local shelter before buying from a pet store; many fancy purebred dogs are often put up for adoption due to unexpected size, medical conditions and even situations where owners have to choose between feeding themselves or their dogs.  These dilemmas result in more homeless pets than ever. If an animal shelter does not offer the breed you are looking for, you should research carefully and find a respectable breeder.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The movie “Dolphin Tale,” directed by Charles Martin Smith, was released in 2-D on September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2011 and is soon to be released in 3-D.  The film, based on a true story, was set in Florida in the Clearwater Marine Hospital. The movie starts with two strangers rescuing a dolphin that lost her tail in a crab trap. Afterwards, they devote their time to caring for their new friend, named “Winter.”  The dedication of the marine biologists, doctors and Sawyer, an adolescent boy, make Winter’s survival possible. The dolphin, currently residing in Florida, is alive thanks to these few people.

After the movie was released, Winter’s story was revealed to the public. People were touched by her story, and looked at Winter as a fortunate survivor, and his caretakers as heroes. The film will stir compassion in any person, and promote an appreciation of our nature. We are hopeful that you will make up the audience to this non-fiction film. A truly meaningful production, "Dolphin Tale" will not disappoint.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Concept:</strong> Batman is trapped in an insane asylum the size of downtown Chicago with every single villain he has ever had the displeasure of meeting. I see nothing wrong with this situation.

<strong>Sound:</strong> The score for this game reminded me a lot of the original Batman animation. Thank goodness. The Adam West version scares me. Mark Hamil also delivers his final performance as the Joker in games and T.V. shows. That alone was enough to make me love the sound.

<strong>Gameplay:</strong> Have you played "Assassin's Creed"? It's like that. Except it's faster and it involves Batman...so it's immediately superior. Controls are very easy to pick up. There's a whole arsenal of gadgets to play with. My personal favorite: the Mister Freeze hand grenade...I'm not kidding. It's real and it's very satisfying. Some may call it delicious. Oh, and you can fly...it's strangely addicting.<!--more-->

<strong>Graphics:</strong> Eye candy is everywhere in this game. You get your own personal slice of the dark metropolis that is Gotham city and it's riddled with well designed character models. All of the villans, and even the Bat himself, look fantastic in this exquisitely detailed environment.

<strong>Replayability:</strong> You like Riddler Challenges? Me neither. I hate that guy. However, even if you hate the Riddler challenges, there are still hours worth of side missions and a New Game+ mode, making the second and third play through just as satisfying as the first.

<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> If you appreciate good graphics quality, high re-playability, strong writing, intuitive controls, and hours of play time, you should buy this game.

		<title>Programming Tutorial: Intro to Ruby! Part 1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I often find myself describing the joys of programming to my friends at school. I tell them about all of the possibilites, the creative liberty, the instant gratification one feels after running code without any errors or bugs. Everyone seems interested enough, but there is always one problem: Nobody knows where to start. I usually try to remedy this situation by showing them how to install Apple's Xcode, or some other IDE (Integrated Development Environment); but by the time they are done downloading stuff, they are already bored. Instead, I could have just showed them how to run simple ruby code using the terminal app and a text editor, tools that come preinstalled on every mac.

What is Ruby? Ruby is a cross-platform, object oriented programming language that originated in Japan during the mid 1990s. It was first designed and developed by a man named Yukihiro Matsumoto, or "Matz" for short. It is said that the languages Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada and Lisp most influenced the development of Ruby. Ruby focuses on simplicity and productivity, and has an easily readable syntax. This means that the code is both easy to read and understand. Alright, enough history. Let's dive right in.<!--more-->

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>
Formatting Note: I have made all of the code <strong>Bold</strong>. This means that everything I want you to enter into the terminal (or later on the text editor) will be in <strong>Bold</strong>. This will help you differentiate it from the rest of the text in the article.

Open up the terminal application on your mac (located within the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder). You should see either a white or black window with a string of text that looks something like this: "Reeds-MacBook-Air:~ reedrosenbluth$". All this means is that I am using a computer called "Reeds Macbook Air"; I am in the home directory (which is represented by the ~ symbol), and I am logged in as reedrosenbluth. I will cover some of the basics on how to explore your mac only using the command line within terminal, but for now let's continue with some Ruby.

To play around with Ruby, you must simply activate a program called Interactive Ruby, or IRB, within your terminal. Luckily, this comes preinstalled on every mac, so all you have to do is type <strong>irb</strong> and hit enter in the terminal window. You should see this "&gt;&gt; ".

Ok, so it's open... Now what?

Well, let's start with some basic math. Type <strong>2 + 2</strong>, and then hit enter. The terminal will output the number 4. Cool right? Try <strong>2*3</strong>, or <strong>(2+2)*3</strong>. You will see that Ruby obeys some of the basic math principles you learned in middle school, such as the order of operations. What about <strong>3^2</strong>? Try it.... Uh Oh... That didn't work did it. That's because the ^ symbol does not raise numbers to a power in Ruby, it is actually a Bitwise operator (don't worry about it for now). In order to raise a number to a power you must type something like this: <strong>3**2, </strong>which will square the number 3.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Variables</strong></h2>
While Ruby can help you with your math homework, the extent of it's capabilities exceed basic algebra. One of the key aspects of programming computers is using variables to represent data. Using variables in Ruby is very simple. In many other languages you have to declare a variable before you can assign it, in order to specify the variables type. In Ruby, this is not necessary. All you have to do is assign the variable like so: type <strong>x = 10</strong> into your terminal window and then press enter. You just assigned a local variable (x) the value 10. Now that you have done this, try entering this: <strong>x*3</strong>. You should get an output of 30. Try typing <strong>y = 8</strong>. Now enter <strong>(x+y)**2</strong>. This will add x (10) and y (8) and square the result.

Variables aren't just for numbers. Type: <strong>name = "George"</strong>, and hit enter. You just assigned a variable (name) the string "George". Now try typing: <strong>puts "Hi, my name is #{name}"</strong>, and hit enter. This code outputs a string (a sequence of characters) with an embedded variable (name), also, under the output you will see this: =&gt; nil. This means that the code returns nil, Ruby’s "absolutely-positively-nothing" value. Don't worry about what that means for now.

Variables are a fundamental aspect of computer programming. Imagine writing a large program, with hundreds of lines of code, where in each line you perform a different mathematical operation on the number 30. All of a sudden you realize you were using the wrong number, you needed to use the number 40 instead of 30. If you had already written this program you would have to go through your code and replace every instance of the number 30 with 40. This would be a huge hassle If you instead assigned the variable x = 30 at the beginning of your program, and used the variable x throughout your program (instead of 30), you could easily change numbers by setting x equal to something else at the beginning of your program.

You are probably thinking that you can't go back and edit your code within the terminal. You are right, the program we are running is an interactive version of ruby. The more common way of programming ruby is to program it in a text editor, and then run it using the command line (terminal) or a ruby IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Getting started with a text editor</strong></h2>
Most programmers write code in either a text editor or an IDE. For this tutorial, we will be using a text editor. Although you can write code in text editors like text edit or Microsoft Word that are already installed on your computer, I highly recommend downloading a text editor that is meant for programming. These editors will have necessary features such as Syntax Highlighting that your typical text editors don't have. I personally use Sublime Text 2 for most of my coding needs besides Objective-C (iPhone and Mac Programming).

Here is their website <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">http://www.sublimetext.com/</a>.

There is a mac version available here: <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-beta">http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-beta</a>.

Another great, free text editor is <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a>.

Open up your text editor of choice and create a new file. Save the file to your desktop as HelloWorld.rb (it is very important that this file name ends with .rb). Edit the file and type in this code: <strong>puts "Hello World"</strong>. Save the file. Now, go back to your terminal window, if you are still in IRB (you still see the &gt;&gt; prompt) press control D on your keyboard to exit (if this doesn't work, just restart terminal). Now, type <strong>ls</strong> in terminal and hit enter. You will see a list of the directories in your home folder on your computer. Type <strong>cd desktop</strong> and then hit enter to navigate to your desktop directory within terminal. Now type <strong>ruby HelloWorld.rb</strong> to run the ruby program we just wrote. If everything worked, you should see the output Hello World. Congratulations, you just successfully ran a ruby program.

Although the Hello World program is not very interesting, there is a lot of cool stuff you can do with Ruby, and programming in general. Think about all of the applications you use on your computer on a daily basis. Your browser, your text editor, iChat. These all started out as lines and lines of code.

Alright, that's it for part 1.

Part 2 will cover: getting and putting input, testing a condition, and defining methods.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2011-2012 Boys varsity soccer team entered this season’s playoffs with high expectations, after winning the state championship in both of the last two years.  The team finished the season well, with a 6-4-4 record.  The team easily advanced to the playoffs, where they looked to “threepeat” by once again winning the state championship.  The team faced off on November 8<sup>th</sup> with Port Jefferson for the Long Island Championship.  The game was extremely close throughout, and even though Friends was unable to score, goalkeeper Eli Russo (’12) shutout Port Jeff with 10 saves to keep the game tied.  At the end of regulation, the game was still tied, which under New York State rules means that the teams play an overtime consisting of two fifteen-minute periods.  The Quakers battled hard, ultimately falling short to Port Jeff by one goal, which came with 4:53 left in the first overtime period.  Although this defeat eliminated the Boys Varsity soccer team from State Championship contention, players were extremely satisfied with the effort put forth by this year’s team.   Even though the team will lose several senior members, players seemed extremely hopeful for next season (no guarantees)!  Even though this year’s boy’s varsity soccer team ultimately fell short of their goals and expectations, the players feel good about their effort and success of this year’s team.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After a summer of research on healthy foods and diets, I felt the need to share it with my lovely Friends Academy peers! Many of us are unaware of what we are <strong>REALLY</strong> eating, as all of those complicated words on the side of the box under ingredients mean almost nothing to us. Us consumers are often tricked by false and ambiguous advertising; if something say's sugar free or low fat we tend to think that means healthy, and buy it without thinking twice. However, a lot of times what we think is healthy, is really not.<img src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /><!--more-->

In the morning it is very difficult to whip up something to eat quickly enough to get to school before the 8:05 morning meeting. Many students either end up not eating breakfast or deciding to eat one of Louis’ famous Bacon, Egg, and, Cheese Sandwiches. What nobody seems to realize is that breakfast is extremely important. Not only do those who skip breakfast end up eating more throughout the day, but they also miss out on the benefits of breakfast. Breakfast will help you stay focused during your morning classes. As for the famous bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, although they are very delicious, eating one <strong>EVERYDAY </strong>can take a serious toll on your body. A healthier option is a Nature Valley Granola Bar and/or an apple. If you are still hungry, try a bowl of Cheerios with one teaspoon of sugar and a banana. During the colder weather, you can swap your cheerios for Oatmeal. If non of these breakfast options appeal to you and you still feel the need to get breakfast from Louis, try to switch it up and get your sandwich with some egg whites, and swap the bagel or roll for its whole-wheat alternative.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="491" caption="Delicous, yet not EVERY morning!"]<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_8228.jpg"><img title="IMG_8228" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_8228-1024x807.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="387" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
It's 10 o’clock. Your stomach is growling. Instead of making a trip all the way to the bookstore, just bring a healthy (and Peanut-Free) snack from home. Great snack ideas include a bag of baby carrots, grapes, an orange, or any vegetable or fruit that appeals to you. All of these options are easy to pack up in a backpack and don’t make a mess. What about when Thursday's roll around, and you simply cannot resist the temptation of that bagel during advisory time? My advice would be to scoop out the inside of your bagel. Doing so reduces the calorie count of the bagel, yet it will still be tasty and filling.

If you are a Freshman or Sophomore, you are most likely starving by second lunch, and if you are an Upper Upperclassman, you are probably trying to rush through lunch to finish that pile of work you have intelligently saved for the free you have before class. Although it is quick, instead of grabbing pre-made chicken fingers and fries and instead of waiting on that sandwich line that is out the door, go to the salad bar. I recommend a simple salad with turkey or chicken, a side of carrots or tomatoes, and to top it off with a light Vinaigrette dressing. The salad bar offers healthy vegetables and there is never a line. If you need something a bit more filling and you are willing to wait on line, exchange your white wrap with a whole wheat or a spinach wrap (though the bright green appearance of the spinach wrap might turn some away, I promise that it tastes exactly the same).

After reading this, I hope you now acquire a taste for healthy eating! Thanks for reading Tiffani’s Healthy Habits! Bon appétit FA!]]></content:encoded>

During my lifetime, and until the past couple of years when it all came crashing down, our country enjoyed seemingly endless financial riches. Money was easy to come by. Ordinary people spent money like crazy; they bought fancy homes, renovated and expanded, they bought luxury items and thought nothing of incurring debt to do it all on a line of credit or with loans.

Banks made money lending to ordinary citizens (who got deeper and deeper into debt). Congress deregulated the financial industry and banks and other financial institutions had less and less government supervision and regulation. They made it easier and easier to get a loan. They made it easier and easier for people to borrow more than they could ever hope to pay back. Yet, people felt richer: and they borrowed even more. Businesses borrowed too. And our nation borrowed from other nations. And the debt grew and grew—the debt of the little guy on Main Street grew; and our national deficit exploded.

The only people (and organizations) making money during that time seems to have been the lenders—the banks, the investment companies, and the private money lenders. The code word for the lenders and banks and investment companies is “Wall Street”—the place where money is traded, invested and traded again. <em>Technically</em>, it’s a street on lower Manhattan. <em>Actually</em>, it’s the heart and home of the stock exchange and the people who work in finance. Wall Street firms gave massive bonuses to their employees—bonuses each year in the millions of dollars. Many Wall Street leaders earned more in his annual bonus than the regular guy on Main Street could earn in a lifetime.

Then, the unthinkable happened. For reasons many debate, the economy of our nation dropped. Stocks fell, businesses collapsed, people lost their jobs, home values plummeted and all the Americans who so easily borrowed couldn’t repay their debts.

The ordinary citizen on Main Street suffered. He lost his job, his home, and defaulted on his loans; therefore he couldn’t pay his way in the world.

And it seemed that the financial leaders on Wall Street continued to prosper. Annual reports on Wall Street were OK, and the annual bonuses were still paid out. To the rare few (the “One Percent”) of our population who made lots of money even though the other 99% were unemployed, stressed and hungry.

Main Street got mad. And Main Street felt unheard, invisible and unimportant. And Main Street rose up. And so, it was born:
<p align="center"><strong>“OCCUPY WALL STREET”</strong></p>
<img src="//9CA0CEF1-59A8-42A0-8AC4-C3F4CC8A7221/occupy_wall_Street_union_thg_111007_wg.jpg" alt="occupy_wall_Street_union_thg_111007_wg.jpg" />

It started in September with a peaceful protest by ordinary citizens gathering in lower Manhattan. It began as a protest in an effort by middle class America to be heard and acknowledged. It started as an effort to exclaim frustration about the inequality between a rich, lucky rarified few who made millions and billions of dollars while others were neck high in debt and now, with the collapse of the economy, jobless.

Occupy Wall Street continued through the fall, grew and grew, and now has outposts in other cities around the country.

<img src="//7E6157DC-6CAF-4F04-A052-91465D2D3E6D/keepCalmLondon.jpg" alt="keepCalmLondon.jpg" />

&nbsp;

The movement has a massive number of participants, volunteers in an army designed to protest financial inequality and to overcome the voicelessness the protesters feel. What Occupy Wall Street doesn’t seem to have is a leader, or a sponsor, or a spokesperson, or a clear message that translates into solution or social action toward change.

Yet, at a time when many are running for political office or supporting political candidates, not one politician has embraced Occupy Wall Street. No one has come out as a spokesperson, not one has embodied the message of the 99%.

Instead, Occupy Wall Street goes on, without a road map for change, and without any political party endorsing the sentiment of the movement. It’s starting to be ridiculed instead as “another Woodstock”—a gathering of hippies reminiscent of the 1960’s—not a positive image. Police are involved, protesters are being arrested, and the message is lost. The original idea of a peaceful protest is quickly disappearing, resulting in violence between the protesters and police. The clashes have become the only events garnering media attention, as Occupy Wall Street's message remains vague.

Imagine if Martin Luther King’s peaceful protests got lost in the absence of a clear message. What if Dr. King’s efforts offered no road map for social change? Nothing in the Civil Rights Movement would have gotten accomplished. The efficacy of this new movement is questionable - whether a fractured group of protestors, each with their own complaints, will spark any kind of major change remains to be seen, but the unorganized nature of this movement is certainly disheartening.

		<title>And the Race Begins -- a Little Early</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s 7:30 in the morning, and Ben is eating a quick breakfast before leaving for his school interview. Both nervous and excited, he wonders what his first interview will be like. Ben’s mother Alice cannot get him to eat fast enough; she is anxiously awaiting the appointment with the head of admissions. The applications, test scores and essays were sent in weeks ago, everything else is up to Ben. Will he be able to show off his fine manners and inquisitive nature? What about his creativity and talent for languages? To any senior applying to college, this should all sound vaguely familiar. One small detail, though: Ben is only four years old, and he is applying to Kindergarten.

Welcome to New York City’s fiercely competitive Kindergarten application process, where neighbors and friends with four and five-year-olds are pitted against each other as they vie for spots in some of the most prestigious elementary schools in America. To many New York City parents, this race is the be-all end-all, as their child’s elementary school experience alone will determine a life of either success or failure. Even those who have sworn to stay far away from the hype suddenly find themselves immersed, sucked in by the intensity that surrounds them.

The first element of a typical Kindergarten application is the essay: a parent’s chance to lay out all of his or her child’s skills and achievements. Weeks and months are spent agonizing over these essays, as parents try desperately to make sure that they have mentioned every one of their kid’s unique talents and abilities. They will often go to great lengths to build on these abilities- it is common for wealthier families to hire foreign au pairs that will be able to teach their children languages like French and Mandarin Chinese. When Alex McCord from the popular Bravo show “The Real Housewives of New York City” was going through the Kindergarten process with her son François, she boasted about his proficiency in French and ability to sing ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star’ in Latin. Involvement in extra-curricular activities from a young age (even younger than four) is also a key element in an outstanding application essay, something that may grab the attention of the admissions officers. As for the number of schools parents consider? Five is modest; many families will send applications to eight, ten, even fifteen. They are determined to maximize the chance that their child will be accepted to a respectable institution.

Next on the application are the test scores. Kids are required to take the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, an evaluation administered by the ERB that tests a child’s motor skills, problem solving and reasoning, among other things.  Similar to the SAT preparation process, parents will often hire expensive coaches to boost their kid’s scores if they feel that he or she will not make the numerical cut for the top-tier schools. At a time where imagination and games of dress-up are an imperative part of life, kids instead spend several hours a week practicing mazes and math problems with a tutor.

The last step of the Kindergarten process is the critical interview at each school on the application list. It involves almost anything that will help the admissions officers to get to know the child, ranging from one-on-one questioning to the observation of the child in a playgroup or classroom setting. Parents have good reason to worry about this, too, since four and five-year-olds are so unpredictable. If a child like Ben decided to squirm his way through the interview while singing the theme song from his favorite cartoon, the admissions officer could deem him “active” and “musically talented” just as easily as “needed to be refocused” and “a bad listener.”

In many ways, the New York City Kindergarten process is just as much of a gamble as the as applying for college. Even if a child is bilingual, musically proficient, and has impressive test scores, he or she may be turned down simply because the school is looking to diversify its student body. Unlike colleges or secondary schools, legacies are rarely taken into account. Hundreds of children can be applying for as few as forty spots; competition is fierce. As the first wave of acceptance letters sweeps the City neighborhoods, some families rejoice, while others are left crushed. The time, money, effort and careful grooming of their sons or daughters has met with no result. Since many social circles equate the name of a good Kindergarten to that of an Ivy League college, parents on the losing end are confronted with a tremendous feeling of inadequacy. In their minds, their child's attendance of the  local, public Kindergarten will ruin their chances of attending a good boarding school, being accepted into a prestigious college, or going to medical or law school. The Kindergarteners, however, remain blissfully unaware of the calamity that has stuck their home and their resultantly bleak future. No, they are just excited for their first day of school, dreams of becoming firefighters, astronauts, or race car drivers occupying their sanguine minds.

If you are a high school feeling overwhelmed by applications, interviews and SATs , just be glad you didn’t have to go through a similar process when you were four years old!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Herman Cain, the man with the golden tie, and wealthy owner of Godfather’s Pizza, is currently the only black, Republican candidate in the upcoming presidential election. Cain, who characterizes himself as striving for the "American Dream" through his fiscal policies (e.g the 999 plan),  appears to be fairly stable at first glance. However, whether or not his acumen for selling pizza will translate to a talent for hawking an entirely different kind of wares on Capitol Hill remains in question. Considering the recent media-driven sexual abuse scandal that erupted around him, things are not looking up.

His alleged association with many women who were affiliated with his company has raised doubts about Cain’s suitability as a president. He responded to the allegations in no uncertain terms: “Never, never have I been accused of any sort of sexual harassment. I never sexually harassed anyone. This false allegation to now come up is kind of baffling” .  And yet, the scandal has hurt his standing in the polls, and led many pundits to cross him off their lists of nominees with any potential.

The skeletons in Cain's closet have been revealed, as they always are for any person subject to public scrutiny. This scandal, as well as his underwhelming performance in debates and interviews, has tempered the popularity of this once burgeoning candidate. If Cain wants to win the nomination, he has an image to remake.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hunger Awareness Day</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hunger Awareness Day is a day where the entire high school community at FA is informed and reminded about hunger around the world. We watch a video during assembly that shares a few statistics regarding the amount of people suffering from hunger right here in Long island, and throughout the world. On top of the video, the FA students experience a taste of hunger themselves. For an entire day, the bookstore is closed. Students are requested to not bring snacks, and the cafeteria serves a very simple pasta dish for lunch. Not only does this day spread awareness, but it also gets students and teachers to contribute to the fight against hunger. Following the video during assembly, advisories work together in order to make meat and cheese sandwiches to distribute to shelters throughout Long Island.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/PB190325.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-534" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/PB190325.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="338" /></a>

A recent study reported that right here on long island there are approximately 285,000 residents, around 110,000 of which are children, battling hunger daily. The US Department of Agriculture has reported a massive increase in hunger over the past few years. The economic recession has left many Long Islanders struggling for food.

Hunger across Long Island is a big focus of WATCH and the club is always looking for those interested in helping. Every Wednesday WATCH hosts sandwich making in the commons from 3:15 – 3:30, help making sandwiches, as well as the donation of supplies are always appreciated. The Sandwiches made on Wednesdays go the INN. The INN consists of many programs to help those struggling from hunger and homelessness across Long Island. They have soup kitchens, emergency shelters, as well as a long-term housing program. On Saturdays, in the commons at FA, there is family sandwich making activities, where students and their families are always welcome and encouraged to help out. WATCH distributes these sandwiches to Island Harvest, a non-profit food bank that distributes food to over 570 agencies.

Island Harvest is a large organization always looking for volunteers. Island Harvest volunteers have many different service opportunities, depending on the amount of time they have to contribute.  The organization needs volunteers to make weekly food runs, delivering the donated food from a commercial food donor to a nearby Island Harvest agency. The organization also needs volunteers for special events, such as food shows, concerts, fairs and large food drives. Help is always appreciated, be it every day, once a week, or even once a year.

The fight to end hunger on Long Island is an arduous one, but with enough generosity on the part of the fortunate, it can be won.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time since Fidel Castro overthrew Batista in 1959, the Cuban government is finally allowing the sale of private property.  Many steps have been taken by Raul Castro in Cuba to make the government style a bit more like a free market.

Currently, Cuba has a socialist economy.  The Cuban citizens as well as the government are either poor or in great debt, which is why these small steps towards a free market have been taken.  However, there are many limitations to these transactions.  Only Cuban residents or foreigners with a permanent residence in the country will be able to participate.  Citizens are limited to one house in the city and one vacation house in the country so that one family does not own too much land.  Buyers will be forced to swear under oath that they do not own any other property and must do the transaction through the Cuban banks.  The state has the right to confiscate and make property public if the person who owns the land does not live in the house for the majority of time.  The upside to the law is that property will be sold even in cases of divorce, death, and desertion.  The hope of this new law is that private capital will begin to move in the economy with private real estate.

In the attempt to create revenue in Cuba, commercial flights are now being flown directly from the United States to Cuba.  On November 6, 2011, a direct flight from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport was made.  Round trip tickets are only available for specialized people through Marazul Tours.  People with relatives in Cuba, business travelers, professionals, students, and potential travelers have been allowed on this flight.  As of December 7, flights to Cuba will occur nine times a week.  This is the United State’s major attempt to break down the barriers with the communist country.

The United States has not traded with Cuba since 1959 when Fidel Castro came into power and jeopardized the United State's agricultural and commercial businesses.  President John F. Kennedy extended the trade restrictions in 1962 prohibiting travel, and financial transactions to occur after the failure of the Bay of Pigs operations and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

These new laws are a step closer to a free market; however, the Cuban government is looking for a balance between political control and a free market.  The Cuban government terminated 500,000 positions and created some opportunities for independent jobs.  Castro feels the need to "update Cuba's economic model" but wants to continue with a socialist government.  Politically, the government has made very few reforms though, some of which started in the 1990s anyways.  With a slowly loosening economy, the United States will begin to trade with Cuba again.  For Cuba as well as the United States, being able to trade with such a close neighbor would be beneficial for both countries.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Friends Academy girls soccer team was anticipating a tough game against their long time rival Stonybrooke for the title of Long Island Champion. The start of the game was a bit rough, as both teams came out strong and eager. The FA girls were putting up a good fight and the team camaraderie stayed strong. Although the FA girls were dominating the field, no one could seem to get the ball in the goal; however, things turned around when Jamie Genatt (number 20) scored the first goal with an assist from Jesse Babicz (number 11) with 10 minutes left in the first half. At the start of the second half, the girls took the field with confidence and looked ready for a win.  The first goal in the second half was scored pretty quickly, and was put in the top right corner of the goal by Alexis Toles. After Alexis' second goal, the girls could not be stopped. One after another goals were being scored; the remainging four goals were scored by Alexis, Krystina Iordanou, Shekinah Pettway and Jesse Babicz. Claudia Ratner, the goalie, only had to stop one ball the entire game because the opposing team could not get past the strong defense. The whistle was blown, and with an exultant win of 6-0, the girls moved on to play for the regional title.

The girls went up against S.S Seward this year for the regional title. They had played against S.S Seward in the same round last year and unfortunately lost 2-1. However, this year the girls brought their "A" game. Jamie Genatt assisted Kasey Katz’s goal in the start of the second half, bringing the score to 1-0. The girls kept up the 1-0 lead until Heather scored the last goal of the game. The final score was 2-0, leaving Friends Academy the title as the Southeast Regional Champions. This was the first time in the history of Friends Academy girl’s soccer that the team made it to states.

&nbsp;

States was an exciting weekend for the girls. I spoke to senior, Jamie Genatt, who said that "it was a weekend she will never forget." The girls went up to Cortland Friday morning, and got ready for their early game on Saturday. In the semi-finals the girls played Keshakwa, a team from upstate NY that was 21-0. It was a tough game, with a lot of scoring for both teams. The final score was 3-2, Friends Academy, which meant the girls were off to the finals. The finals were on Sunday at 10:30 against Hoosick Falls. It was apparently one of the most exciting games for the girls and the fans. The teams were so evenly matched that by the end of the 80 minutes, it was 0-0. The game went into two 10 minute half overtimes, where the score remained 0-0. That was followed by 10 minutes of sudden death where neither team scored again. In the state finals, if the teams are still tied after both overtimes, the game is called as a tie. So, Friends Academy and Hoosick Falls were Co-State Champions. First time in history for a girls sports team at FA to win states! Congratulations Girls Varsity Soccer!

		<title>FA’s Upcoming Play: Guys and Dolls!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we all know, FA has a wonderful theater program, which currently just finished the play “Much A Do About Nothing”. It was a fabulous production with great scenery, actors, actresses, singing, and choreography. All of the hard work that went into it paid off because the play was quite a success! The same dedication of students and faculty will be put into the winter production, “Guys and Dolls.”

“Guys and Dolls” is a musical that is based on "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idyll_of_Miss_Sarah_Brown">The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown</a>" and "Blood Pressure", two short stories by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Runyon">Damon Runyon</a>;  music and lyrics by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Loesser">Frank Loesser</a> and book by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Swerling">Jo Swerling</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_Burrows">Abe Burrows</a>. The Broadway musical first premiered in the 1950’s and won the Tony Award for Best Musical. "Guys and Dolls" is a fable about what happens to gambling men and the women who long to tame them. Set in the colorful world of New York City in the mid 20th century, the romantic and funny "Guys And Dolls" is populated with gangsters and gamblers, missionary dolls and scantily clad showgirls, and one the great musical scores in the history of American theatre.

Tracey Foster, our head of Theater at FA, has chosen Guys and Dolls to be the winter play because she thinks it is a different type of play because there will be a lot more group singing and dancing. Only Upper School will participate and audition for the play. The students, faculty, and even parents have shown a huge interest: “people have come up to me and started singing songs from the musical. They just can’t wait to audition!” Tracey told me.

Tracey has yet to decide though, which route she will take the scenery in: Traditional vs. The FA way.  For the traditional way, the scenery would be of New York City during the 1950’s, with a cartoon feeling and bright colors. The FA way would depict a realistic backdrop of New York City during the 1950’s with neon lights and rain reflected on white cement to represent a gritty look.

“Energy will keep going from the last play.” Tracey told me at the end of our discussion. There will be a tremendous amount of effort put into the play including Kimo, our choreographer, Mr. Liverani who is in charge of the band, and Mr. Regalman who will be in charge of all singing.  The play will take place on February 9, 10, &amp;11 at 7:30 p.m. Stayed tuned for more information regarding the play and even a couple of secrets! It’s going to be fabulous!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As winter quickly approaches, cool weather trends are appearing in the wardrobes of many FA students. As FA girls are good at staying up-to-date in the fashion world, the trends they are/will soon be sporting around campus can also be spotted throughout the pages of InStyle and Teen Vogue.

This winter you can expect to see bright colors that are not often worn in the colder months, such as brilliant fuchsias, electric oranges and bold blues. These shocking colors will be sure to appear anywhere from corduroys to chunky scarves. If you are eager to take part in this new trend, you can shop at stores like JCrew, Orvis, Rugby and Bloomingdales. Plus with all of the holidays approaching, you can be sure to get great deals and sales on these hot new items.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/kath.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-606" title="kath" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/kath-685x1024.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="614" /></a></p>
If you are hesitant to wear bright colors because you aren’t sure what type of shoes to wear, look no further than your own closet! When you are already making a strong statement with your pants or scarf, there is no need to go overboard with the shoes. Any of your neutral colored Sperrys, moccasins, Toms, or ballet flats will be perfect to keep the attention on your bold pieces.

As shown, many FA girls have already picked up the key themes for Winter 2011, so why don’t you try it next!

Click below to see how our very own Katherine Hom, Rebecca Melman, Carolyn Cahill, and Katie Pappas showed off these trends!

		<title>2012 Election: Personality or Policy?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When American voters go to the polls on November 6<sup>th</sup>, 2012, will they vote for the better person or the better politician?  Herman Cain’s (R) campaign ended just this month after personal allegations ruined his reputation;  while the validity of these allegations has no effect on Herman Cain’s ability to lead, his campaign’s popularity fell quickly.  As Cain’s alleged past has come back to haunt him, former republican Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich has stepped up.  But Gingrich, who as of December 12<sup>th</sup> was at the top of GOP Polls, has an unfaithful past of his own.  Gingrich, who is in his third marriage, has been known to cheat on his wives.  And while Gingrich’s rivals have and will try to emphasize his infidelity, does that really take away from his ability to lead?

Past Americans have had no trouble electing, or at least nominating, adulterers: John F. Kennedy (D), Bill Clinton (D), and John McCain (R), to name a few.  None of these men has proven to have impaired leadership abilities due to his faithlessness, so why is it relevant?!  While it is not right to cheat on one’s spouse, it doesn’t make someone bad at his or her job!

Faithfulness is not the only aspect of personality that dominates public opinion on a nominee.  Massachusetts’s Governor Mitt Romney (R), whose campaign has built him up as a ‘Family Man’ in an attempt to downplay Gingrich, has received criticism for his Mormon Faith.  Mormonism, a faith that originated in America, is still a Christian religion, so Romney would not become the first president whose religion is not affiliated with Jesus Christ (Another GOP Nominee, Utah Governor Jon Huntsman (R), is also Mormon).  Mitt Romney’s religion would not affect his ability to be an effective President, but it very well may affect his ability to get elected!

In the case that personality, not policy, becomes the largest issue in next year’s election, current President Barack Obama could emerge on top, regardless of constantly dropping approval ratings from all parts of the country.  Unfortunately, it appears that Americans will probably pay more attention over the next year to which candidate has the least number of personal problems, not, for example, which politician has the best economic policy. In my eyes, that marks a severe deficiency in the current political atmosphere.

		<title>Mass Effect 3: One of the Most Anticipated Games of 2012</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Voted the <strong>Most Anticipated Game </strong>at the 2011 Videogame Awards, Mass Effect 3 is set to be released March 6, and while this release date is still around 3 months away, fans are going wild and showing off their loyalty to the series with costume contests, forum discussions, and game play-throughs; crazed fans are even stalking Casey Hudson (the head game developer) on Twitter. The franchise has more than earned its obsessive following; the first two games (Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2) were seen as revolutionary to the gaming industry.

From the moment the players pick up the controller, they take on the identity of Commander Shepard. Players have near-total freedom of character customization; gender, appearance, past, and personality are all picked by the player at the beginning of the first game. If a player finishes the first game and wishes to go on to the second, he or she can import the character from the first game into the second game; however, all of the choices from the first game will have repercussions in the second. Players also have the option to start the second game without an import, and instead can play through an interactive comic in the second game to get them up to speed with the plot, and allow them to make game-altering choices.

Every action and verbal response is chosen by the player, and, like in real life, poor decisions can come back to haunt you. Say you punch out a salesman in the first game; in the second game they may not be willing to provide you with a discount on supplies. Therefore, accomplishing your goals will be much harder if money is tight, which it often can be. To further add to the realism, squad mates can also be killed, and with the incredible amount of character development put into the game, losing a squad member can be quite depressing.

The third game places Commander Shepard at the head of an intergalactic effort to stop the Reapers, a race of ancient sentient machines bent on destroying all organic life. To even have a slim chance of saving the galaxy, Shepard has to unite the different races, something that can prove very difficult depending on past alliances and actions in the previous games.  Judging by the trailers, which promise enhanced combat mechanics, new weapons, spectacular graphics, and excellent voice acting, Mass Effect 3 appears to be a game that will leave all players on the edge of their seats from start to finish, especially since in the Mass Effect series, failure is a very real possibility (and nobody wants to be seen as the failure that let all organic life be destroyed, right?)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nobody wants to get the flu - the aching, congestion, and nauseating paroxysms of coughing that come with it are enough to make anyone miserable. However, at the same time nobody wants to receive a treatment for it that might be unnecessary or ineffective. The influenza vaccine, known more commonly as the flu shot, is a worthwhile method to protect against the highly contagious influenza virus.

A vaccine exposes your immune system to a dead or weakened virus that you can fight; your body builds up antibodies that allow it to fend off the real virus. The shot contains three seasonal influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season (for the 2011-2012 season the virus strains are two Influenza A viruses, H1N1 and H3N2, as well as one Influenza B virus). Now you may be thinking that your youth and good health will protect you from such infection;  but while you will be far less likely to suffer severe complications from the virus, you still run the risk of catching the flu.

With the bitter cold winter season quickly approaching, it is crucial for your body to adjust to changes. An annual seasonal flu vaccine is a great way to reduce the chances that you will get seasonal flu and reduce the probability that you will spread it to others.  It is important to get the flu shot annually because flu viruses are constantly changing and flu vaccines may be updated from one season to the next to protect against the most recent and most commonly circulating viruses. Also your immune protection begins to decline overtime, so it is important for your body to “renew” its protection. All it takes is one little shot and you’ll be set!

		<title>Programming Tutorial: Intro to Ruby! Part 2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi everyone, welcome to Part 2 of my Intro to Ruby tutorial series. In <a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2011/11/07/programming-tutorial-intro-to-ruby-part-1/">Part 1</a> I covered some very basic concepts such as basic math, variables, and using a text editor to write code. In this tutorial we will continue right where we left off, so fire up your favorite text editor and get ready to learn about input, type casting and testing a condition.

Note: Rather than posting all of the code in <strong>bold</strong> like I did in Part 1, this tutorial will display code snippets which will be analyzed and explained. This makes more sense because we will be writing longer and more substantial programs in this tutorial compared to the simple one liners we wrote in Part 1. I will still use <strong>bold</strong> text to refer to code from the snippets.

&nbsp;
<h2>Input (User Interaction)</h2>
One of the most essential parts of the applications we use on our computers and mobile devices is how they interact with the user. On our computers we typically interact with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with a cursor. More recent GUI technology include the multi-touch gestures made famous by OSX and touch screens on mobile devices. In Part 1 of this series the basic programs we wrote did not interact with the user at all, they simply output a number or a string of letters. Although we will not be writing any software with GUIs quite yet, we can interact with the user by allowing him or her to type something in the terminal. Let's start out by modifying the standard "Hello World" application to address the user by his or her name. Type this code into your text editor, save it as HelloWorld.rb, and run it in terminal (instructions on how to do this are covered in <a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2011/11/07/programming-tutorial-intro-to-ruby-part-1/">Part 1</a>). After it runs, you will see the text "Enter your name: " in your terminal. Type your name into terminal and hit ENTER.

<code lang="ruby">print("Enter your name: ")
name = gets()
puts("Hello #{name}")
</code>

Although this code is still very simple, it has some important functions. First, we simply print "Enter your name: ". It is important to know that we use <strong>print</strong> instead of <strong>puts</strong> because <strong>puts </strong>adds a new line at the end of the printed string, whereas <strong>print</strong> does not. We want the cursor to remain on the same line as the prompt. On line 2 we use <strong>gets()</strong> to read in a string when the user presses ENTER. This string is then assigned to the variable <strong>name</strong>. The last line of code is fairly interesting. In this line, the <strong>name</strong> variable is embedded into the string. This is done by placing the variable between two curly brackets preceded by a hash mark, as in <strong>#{}</strong>. This kind of embedded evaluation will only work when your string is surrounded by double quotes. If your code looked like <strong>puts('Hello #{name}')</strong>, where the only difference is that I am using single quotes, your string would be printed exactly like that, or in other words, your name variable would never get printed. One more thing. The parentheses after <strong>gets()</strong> and also those surrounding the string following <strong>print </strong>and <strong>puts</strong> are all optional. The code would run fine without them. Some compilers will give you warnings if you leave them out and parentheses can sometimes help make programs more clear and easy to read. Take note that in future programs we write in these tutorials we may or may not use parentheses.

&nbsp;
<h2>Type Casting</h2>
Let's write something a little bit more complicated (and useful!). This program will help you split the cost of dinner with your friends

<code lang="ruby">print "Enter the cost: "
cost = gets.to_f
print "How many people? "
people = gets.to_f
final_cost = cost/people
puts("The cost per person is $#{final_cost}")
</code>

All that is happening in this program is that we are assigning two variables based on the users input (<strong>cost</strong> and <strong>people</strong>) and then we do some simple math to calculate the final cost. The only thing that occurs in this program that you don't know about is the <strong>to_f</strong> cast method. Type casting is a method of switching from one data type to another. For example, in this program after the user is prompted to "Enter the cost: " the user enters a string of characters (in this case numbers) which are stored in the <strong>cost</strong> variable. Later on in the program we perform some division that involves both our <strong>cost</strong> and <strong>people</strong> variables. But wait, how do you divide two strings? You can't. You can only perform mathematical operations on numbers. This is where the <strong>to_f</strong> method comes into play. As you can see, instead of typing <strong>cost = gets</strong> like I might have in the last program we wrote, I instead wrote <strong>cost = gets.to_f</strong>. This <strong>to_f </strong>method converts our cost string into a floating point. A floating point is simply a way of representing numbers. Another option would be to use <strong>to_i</strong>, which would convert the string to an integer. The reason I do not do this is because integers get rounded and don't contain decimals, while floating points do.

&nbsp;
<h2>Testing a Condition: if..then</h2>
There is one problem with our "dinner splitting" program that we wrote above: it accepts negative numbers. Consequently, we must check for negative numbers, and when found, set them to zero. This is the new version of the code.

<code lang="ruby">print "Enter the cost: "
cost = gets.to_f
print "How many people? "
people = gets.to_f
final_cost = cost/people

if (final_cost < 0.0) then
final_cost = 0.0
end

puts("The cost per person is $#{final_cost}")</code>

I simply added what is called an <strong>if statement</strong>. The code acts very similarly to how it reads. If the final cost of the meal is less than zero dollars, it sets the final cost equal to zero. The first line of the if statement is called the test condition. It is what gets tested before the next line of code gets run. Conditional statements like the if statement are extremely useful when coding and appear all over the place. In addition to the if statement, there are many other extremely useful conditional statements such as the if else statement, the elsif statement, the unless statement, and the case statement. You can learn more about conditional statements <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sarah.allen/ruby-conditionals" target="_blank">here</a></span>.

Well that pretty much covers it for Part 2. Part 3 will delve further into ruby programming, mainly focusing on how to define methods.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>In Review: Florence + the Machine - Ceremonials</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2012/01/05/in-review-florence-the-machine-ceremonials/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Florence + the Machine first joined the UK music scene in March of 2009 with their extended play <em>A lot of Love. A lot of Blood, </em> the world got its first taste of her powerful, mesmerizing vocals. Four months later, the group released their first full length album, <em>Lungs, </em>through Island Records. Reaching the top of UK charts that January and going platinum five times over, <em>Lungs</em> proved beyond doubt that the band’s unique and refreshing sound had made quite the impression.

Considering the smashing success of their first album, many were unsure whether Welch and the varying crew of musicians who support her would be able to maintain their prominence. All the same, skeptics were silenced by Florence’ second release, <em>Ceremonials, </em>which reached the top of the charts in the UK, Australia, Ireland, and England.

<em>Ceremonials, </em>recorded at Abbey Road Studios with Paul Epworth, gracefully transitions between lament and glorious resplendence. Saturated with large beats, majestic tones, and gospel touches, the album amplifies the theatrics and dramatic, bold arrangements of their debut, <em>Lungs. </em>It is a vastly inflated version of its predecessor - blustering rhythms made ominous by the ever-present howling of a distant storm.

<em>“Shake it Out,” “What the Water Gave Me,” and “Leave My Body”  </em>feature Welch’s glorious, gospel choruses, adroitly balancing the importance of a mesmerizing hook with evocative lyrical poetry. <em>"Lover, Lover" </em>combines Welch's soulful voice with something that hints at classic Motown, making a strong resemblance to Adele's style.

[grooveshark width="600" height="270" type="songlist" id = "33344993,33344985,33345050,33449475" random="0" skin="bbg=000000&bth=000000&pfg=000000&lfg=000000&bt=FFFFFF&pbg=FFFFFF&pfgh=FFFFFF&si=FFFFFF&lbg=FFFFFF&lfgh=FFFFFF&sb=FFFFFF&bfg=666666"]Ceremonials[/grooveshark]

<em>Ceremonials</em> meets just criticism in its often blaring, overpowering ...largeness. <a title="Pitchfork's Review" href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16004-ceremonials/">Pitchfork</a> called the massive melodrama a manifestation of Welch's overzealous ambition, and said that the album had lost the pleasing though unsettling variation of style that <em>Lungs </em>had. <a title="The Guardian's Review" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/oct/30/florence-machine-ceremonials-review">The Guardian</a> was hesitant to call the record anything but interesting, as its most apparent aspect was the size of the predominant sounds, that <em>Ceremonials </em>is all bluster and no substance.

Aims of the industry aside, <em>Ceremonials </em>provides an array of calming, haunting, exciting, and uplifting tracks that, while requiring the occasional respite to regain one's breath, are inspiring and heartening in their openness (granted, what some might call gratuitousness). Welch's indefatigable vocals carry the album and earn it its criticism, but, either way, they are worth the listen.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If there is one thing apparent in the upcoming presidential election, it’s that the religious right is very, very well represented. Even with Bachmann out of the running, and Perry going back to Texas to “think”, the ultraconservatives still have another chance to tear down the wall of separation between church and state in Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. While his advocacy of shrinking government and reducing corporate regulation are mainstream conservative views, Santorum also embodies another ideology that I find considerably more frightening.

That ideology is a particularly strict form of Christianity. During his campaign in Iowa, Santorum declared that “our civil laws have to comport with a higher law: God’s law.” He believes that the law of his God and the secular laws that govern our country should be merged, and that the continuing discord between the two creates “agitation”. Whatever that means.

He is a victim of the widespread misconception that this country is a “Christian nation”, which, no matter which particular tribe you hail from, is entirely fallacious. The founding fathers were primarily deist in their personal convictions, and some could even be described as anti-clerical. In particular, Thomas Jefferson’s disgust with organized religion is rather clear in one of his letters to Alexander Von Humbolt in 1813: “History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their civil as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purposes.” Jefferson's religious views bear a stark contrast to those of Santorum who wants to merge the civil laws described in the bible, so-called “Biblical truths”, irrespective of how the public might feel about them. In Santorum’s own words: “We have Judeo-Christian values that are based on biblical truth. ... And those truths don't change just because people's attitudes may change."

Santorum’s strict, religious convictions dictate a number of bigoted and sometimes quixotic policy decisions. He believes that rape victims should be forced to bring to term the child of their rapist. Since life, in his view, begins from conception, victims of such horrid a trespass of rights as rape cannot opt out of creating a constant reminder of the destruction of their dignity and autonomy. Additionally, he would ban gay marriage, and even go so far as to annul unions that have already been officiated; thereby callously dissolving the vows and destroying the families of thousands of American citizens. Santorum would end federal funding for birth control and allow states to make it illegal. The candidate also signed a pledge called “The Marriage Vow” by the Family Leader Organization planning to oppose pornography.

Rick Santorum’s religious positions are not far removed from that of the Taliban, who are actively trying to instate Sharia Law in the Middle East. Ironically, Santorum warns against the supposed creeping influence of Muslims who want to impose their religious law on non-muslims in the states. The proposed institution of Sharia Law is an attempt by Muslims to merge their religious doctrines with their government. Sound familiar?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi there,

While it may not be quite so obvious why Inkwell is a better home for the weekly update, there are a number of reasons it belongs here.

Inkwell is much more convenient for users on mobile devices that aren't iPhones. While FirstClass only has an iPhone app, we have a beautiful mobile site that works on any mobile browser. We are also in the process of building a native iPhone app.

The weekly update is simply better looking and more functional on Inkwell. We can format in ways that weren't possible through email. We can add rich multimedia and interactive content.

While it is true that Inkwell is running slightly slower than usual due to the increased traffic we have been having recently, we plan on switching our hosting to a much faster web server as soon as possible.

Also, If you sign up for our email subscription at the bottom of the site, the weekly update will be emailed to you similarly to how it was before.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>FOTF Co-opts Tebow</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2012/01/24/religion-and-sports/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tim Tebow. It's a name many know well, but not just because of his football record. The player's fervent religious convictions have been much discussed in the media since he rose to prominence. Tebow’s success has spread ‘Tebowmania’, and people everywhere now copy  Tebow’s signature celebration of praying on one knee, referred to as 'Tebowing.'  My first article about Tebow discussed his great success as quarterback for the Denver Broncos throughout this past season.  The article did not, however, touch upon the controversial aspects of Tebow's over publicized faith, and the fact that he is considered the NFL’s most religious player.

The other night I was watching Tebow’s Broncos, who had surprised the world again by advancing to the second round of the playoffs, play Tom Brady’s New England Patriots, often considered one of the best teams in football.  The game was midway through the second quarter and the Broncos were losing badly.  During a commercial break, an ad came on featuring a bunch of children speaking together on screen. I wasn’t really paying attention at first, but as the ad continued, I realized it was a bible verse.  The reading was John 3:16, and the ad intentionally came during a time when Tebow, the most outspoken religious player in professional sports, was playing.  I usually have no problem with Tebow’s religious nature; I laud his restraint from drugs and sex, and ignore his post game thanks to Jesus for helping him on his miraculous wins. I even find myself defending Tebow for his sincerely held beliefs when others are arguing that he is slowly taking football's secularity away.  But this commercial went too far, and was a direct result of Tebow’s behavior.

Focus on the Family (FOTF), the Christian organization who aired the ad, said later that “Tebow ... is the cultural phenomenon that inspired [the commercial].”  I was annoyed at this ad more as a football fan, than a non-Christian/Jew. When did football become about advertising particular religious beliefs?  The ad was FOTF’s second in the last year, the first one featured Tebow with his mother, while a third ad was rejected by FOX for last year’s super bowl (that commercial also centered around the verse John 3:16).  I feel an ad with such religious affiliation has no place in football.  The NFL has offered an optional post game prayer service, but players are invited to pray by themselves to accommodate for different religions.  The NFL has always tried to keep religion out of its sports, but allowing this commercial failed to do so.

Tim Tebow’s religious impact on the NFL should not overshadow his success in the league, or his miraculous ability to win.  That being said, the NFL has always been successful in keeping religion out of its sport, and Tebow’s impact has partially removed that secularity.  Religion and football should be kept separate, and the NFL should work to prevent commercials or advertisements that work to advance and spread particular beliefs (religious or otherwise).

Although it is unfortunate that religion was brought to the game of football, it is worth noting that, at the end of the day, the first amendment gives companies like Focus on the Family the right to air commercials inspired by and featuring specific athletes.

		<title>Do Artificial Sweeteners Actually Cause Cancer?</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2012/01/21/do-artificial-sweeteners-actually-cause-cancer/</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2012 03:49:33 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone has heard at one time or another that “artificial sweeteners cause cancer". I often hear it from people while I’m sipping Diet-Coke or sweetening my coffee with some Splenda. However, just how valid is this statement? Especially considering the dramatization of every tidbit of news that reaches the public and the multiple contradictory studies on the subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In an article entitled "<em>Artificial Sweeteners and the Risk of Gastric, Pancreatic, and Endometrial Cancers in Italy"</em>, Italian researchers claimed that they performed a study that "adds further evidence on the absence of [a negative] effect of low-calorie sweetener." From another study, "<em>Artificial Sweeteners and Cancer Risk in a Network of Case–Control Studies,"</em> researchers concluded that there is <em>“</em>a lack of association between saccharin, aspartame and other sweeteners and the risk of several common neoplasms,” or tumors. Yet another study, "<em>Life-Span Exposure to Low Doses of Aspartame Beginning during Prenatal Life Increases Cancer Effects in Rats</em>," finds a connection between artificial sweeteners and cancer. The study claims to have “reinforce[d] the first experimental demonstration of… carcinogenicity at a dose level close to the acceptable daily intake for humans.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why the contradiction? For starters, let us look at the test subjects: rats. In the 1970s, saccharin containing products were legally mandated to carry a warning label based on a study done on rats. These findings were later reversed because it was found that the chemical effects being viewed by the researchers were specific to male rats, not humans. Oddly enough, the first two studies mentioned in this article were on humans and concluded that there was no correlation between cancer and artificial sweeteners, and the third study that found a connection, as stated in its title, was performed on rats.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Second, let’s look at the doses being given to these test subjects. A test from the 1980s said that aspartame, another artificial sweetener, caused cancer; however, what was initially not known by the public was that some of the doses given to the rats were equivalent to a human drinking up to 2000 cans of diet soda a day. Excessive amounts of anything, even water or vitamins, can be detrimental to one's health; therefore, these studies prove very little.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So the question remains: Do artificial sweeteners cause cancer? The answer, at least from my perspective, is <strong>maybe</strong>. If all the studies agreed, then I, along with many others, would be firmly convinced. However, every search I ran and every study I read had one that contradicted it, leading me a bit skeptical of the cancer-causing effects of artificial sweeteners. A can or two of Diet-Coke is probably not going to do you in. Nonetheless, too much of anything can be harmful, and carcinogenic or not I'd recommend keeping your daily dosages of artificial sweeteners within reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can access the studies yourself <a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/18/8/2235.abstract http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1964906/ ">here</a> and <a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/18/8/2235.short http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/artificial_sweetener_myths.htm">here</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Interview with Katie Bauer, Literary Editor and Cecilia Judge, Art Editor.

LEADERS:
Gary Schmidt, Club Advisor.
Kathryn Bauer, Literary Editor.
Cecilia Judge, Art Editor
Yasmin Kibria, Publicity
Carl Simpson, Layout Editor
MISSION: Gnosis is our school’s literary magazine club. Its purpose is to feature the artistic talents of our community and allow students to, as Katie Bauer puts it, “get their voice out there through art.”
SUBMISSIONS: Submissions on art and literature are welcomed, including poems, short stories, photographs, sketches, paintings - even doodles. Gnosis is looking for interesting pieces that show effort, skill, and substance.
Even if you are not completely confident that your piece will be selected, submit it anyway. Gnosis really needs submissions! Plus, you never know!
THEME: Our theme this year is the four seasons - winter, summer, fall, and spring. However, submissions do not have to relate to the theme. We will find a place for your work.
HOW TO SUBMIT: If you would like your work to be featured in the literary magazine, you must first create a digital copy. You can either upload it to Gnosis’ First Class Conference or email it to Doc Schmidt and/or the editorial staff.
MEMBERS: Editorial staff receive submissions and finalize choices. Regular staff vote on submissions and arrange the layout. All members are asked to submit at least 2 pieces of art or writing so that they may understand better what works are appropriate for Gnosis.  According to Cecilia Judge, members should be “open to try new things.” Editors and seniors of Gnosis offer mentorship and advice if needed.
MEETINGS: The meetings are usually during Wednesday lunch blocks in Doc Schmidt’s room. Meetings are only held when Gnosis needs to make a decision or to work on a project.
HOW TO JOIN: Come to one of Gnosis’ meetings or speak with Doc Schmidt.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="text-align: left;">Ever heard: “Dancing a sport? Are you kidding me? It’s so easy to learn a couple moves to music.” or “Golf isn’t a sport; it’s a skill!”? We have all heard these comments regarding activities that people don't consider sports. I don’t play golf or dance, but I am an equestrian who is often confronted with similar statements. Many people assume that the horse does all the work and that the rider just sits there. These assumptions are often made by people who have never really tried the sport at a high level. For example, someone whose last encounter with a horse was a pony ride at a birthday party when he or she was five.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">As one of history’s oldest methods of transportation, horseback-riding had long been considered a necessity. However, when the automobile was invented, horse-back riding emerged as a sport. In fact, several types of Equestrianism emerged: Racing, Show Jumping, Western Barrel Racing and Cow Roping, Dressage, Eventing and Foxhunting. Although these disciplines vary greatly in style, purpose and execution, each involves a bond between horse and rider that must be achieved through an unspoken language. In other words, a human must communicate with a 1,000-or-more pound animal simply through a series of subtle gestures. Instead of relying on a team, another individual, or him/herself riders must rely on a different being altogether- one with its own ideas and thoughts, and one that is not always in the mood to listen.</p>
So where does the athleticism component come in? For starters, riders use almost every muscle in their body to stay balanced and secure atop a large animal as it vaults itself over even larger obstacles. A rider’s legs are usually the most important, helping to both support and urge the horse forward, while also keeping the rider in place. Strong arms are essential to direct a horse around sharp turns, and check its pace. Core and back muscles are vital to maintain an elegant position: remember, all of this has to look effortless. The horse and the rider must memorize complex courses, and the rider must decide when to signal the mounts while still maintaining perfect timing and precision; similar to memorizing a play in football and timing the throw of the quarterback and the runs of the other players in order to score a touchdown.

While riding may not have the same cardiovascular effects as running a lacrosse ball down a field, it can be easily compared to lifting weights at the gym. In addition, there are more than 300 colleges and universities in America that offer horseback riding as a varsity sport. So next time you come to quick conclusions about a particular sport or activity, I will sharply reply: “I’d like to see you try.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Would You Like to Be a Mo Bro? </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some of you may have wondered why throughout the month of November, a number of male teachers were sporting more facial hair than usual. The teachers were growing mustaches for a month-long event called <em>Movember</em>. <em>Movember</em> is a prostate cancer awareness campaign that started in Australia.

Once one registers as a participant at the Movember website, he is officially known as a “Mo Bro.” The Mo Bro must start the month of November completely shaven and grow a moustache throughout the 30 days. Participants are not only helping because they are seeking sponsorship in order to raise funds for their mustache growing exertions, but they are also walking advertisements for the awareness of men’s health issues. The crazier the mustache, the more awareness the participants will spread; common mustaches during the month of <em>Movember</em> are the Handlebar, a bushy mustache with ends that point up; the Fu Manchu, with its long, downward pointing ends; and many more. The funds that are raised will go to prostate cancer research as well as other cancers that affect men. In the past, Americans have raised $7.5 million for <em>Movember</em>, and worldwide $174 million was raised.

&nbsp;

According to the American Cancer Society one in every six men will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and one in every 36 will die from it. Prostate Cancer is the second leading cause of death in men, following lung cancer. Movember hopes that through awareness and donations, prevention as well as progress in research will greatly decrease this statistic.

How to get involved for next <em>Movember</em>:
<ol>
	<li>Once registered at <strong>Movember.com</strong> each Mo Bro must begin the 1<sup>st</sup> <em>Movember</em> with a clean shaven face</li>
	<li>For the entire month of <em>Movember</em> each Mo Bro must grow and groom a moustache</li>
	<li>There is to be no joining of the mo to one’s side burns (that is considered a beard)</li>
	<li>There is to be no joining of the handlebars to one’s chin (that is considered a goatee)</li>
	<li>Each Mo Bro must conduct himself like a true country gentleman</li>
</ol>

		<title>Hats: A FAshion Necessity</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2012/02/01/hats-a-fashion-necessity/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Philip Treacy, a hat designer, made the fashion world go mad when his pieces were spotted on some of our favorite royals like Kate Middleton and Princess Beatrice. His one of-a-kind design’s have become an international sensation, especially after Kate Middleton revealed in an interview that she plans her outfits around Treacy's hats.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/kate_middleton_getty.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-876" title="kate_middleton_getty" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/kate_middleton_getty-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>

When creating an outfit, it is essential to pick an accent piece; whether it be a necklace, shoes or even an embellished top, focus must be drawn to one piece. Most FA students do this unconsciously, by making their bright colored corduroy’s pop against their neutral button downs, or their scarves stand out against their jackets. Although FA does not allow hats in school, if you are interested in staying trendy and fashionable, begin making your hat the focal piece of your outfit on weekends and nights out. When you are looking to go to the city, out to dinner or out with friends, you will have a perfect look to try out! Any hat from a fedora to a beret to a bowler is a great way to get involved in the trend, as they are stylish without being too over the top. These cute, stylish and practical hats can be found at stores like Urban Outfitters, Jcrew, Forever 21 and Anthropologie.

In a recent issue of Teen Vogue, editor Jane Keltner de Valle put Treacy's hats to the test when she wore them while out and about in New York City; she paired a striped cloche with a Victoria Beckham dress. Jane noticed that while wearing a hat not only did she get multiple compliments and positive stares, but she had better posture, and conducted herself more formally! So if you're looking for fashion compliments, a better posture or simply a fun style challenge, try pairing your next outfit with a hat!

		<title>Gingrich&#039;s Accusations Towards Romney are Unwarranted</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past week at Friend’s Academy was the famous Peace Week, which arrives once a year. This year’s peace week revolved around the issue of poverty throughout the United States. A few things we learned during Peace week through many videos and assemblies were that that many people who are currently struggling with poverty have either lost their jobs or are underemployed by companies that have been hit hard by the recession.

As it turns out, one of the current candidates for the presidency is implicated in the mismanagement of just such a company. Mitt Romney, the candidate in question, known for his Mormon background and his business-like demeanor, has made bounding steps over the other republican candidates. Recently, however, he has been under attack by another republican candidate, Newt Gingrich, on a website called “The King of Bain”.

Not only has the website called Romney himself the king of Bain, but the website has also accused Romney of being one of the cooperate raiders that caused the recent downturn in the economy. The accusations are that Mitt Romney and his “cronies” contributed to deindustrialization in America because they used overseas services to manufacture products. However, with the increased globalization of today's markets, it would be unreasonable and unsustainable for Romney's business to keep all of its labo in the States. Unfortunately this system leaves many Americans jobless, but at the same time is, I believe, an inevitable reality of the business world.

Many people wonder at length why no one has taken action in stopping overseas production of American goods, but I think the answer is fairly simple: Everything that Mitt Romney has been accused of is merely a part of our nation’s capitalistic economy and is in no way against the law. Even so, these recent accusations may hurt Romney in the upcoming election.

<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>The Friends Academy Varsity Chess Team is attempting a third consecutive county championship following their undefeated 2011 season. On Wednesday, Feb. 1</strong><strong><sup>st</sup></strong><strong>, chess teams from Great Neck North, Syosset, and Jericho will converge at Jackson House for four hours of competition, from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., with a half hour break for lunch. GO FA CHESS! </strong></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Hey there football fanatics! Next Friday, February 3rd, SFB is proudly sponsoring a Super Bowl Dress Down Day! We are asking that you come to school in either Patriots and Giants jerseys, or in Patriots and Giants colors (</strong><strong>blue</strong><strong>/</strong><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>silver</strong></span><strong>/</strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>red</strong></span><strong>/</strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>white</strong></span><strong> for Pats, </strong><strong>blue</strong><strong>/</strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>red</strong></span><strong>/</strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>white</strong></span><strong> for Giants). Our regular monthly dress down day is rescheduled for the following Friday, February 10, so all of you non-sports goers need not worry. Any questions, you can contact Devin Gerzof or any other of your accomplished peers on the Student Faculty Board. </strong></span>

Please keep in mind that integrity and decency is also expected as always

&nbsp;

- <strong>tables in the lunchroom</strong>- leaving garbage behind – if you made the mess, clean up after yourself – consider the next person who is going to sit at this table- show him/her the respect that you would expect in having a clean table to eat from.

&nbsp;

- <strong>dress code</strong>- again need to be respectful of the school policy.

Modesty and simplicity need to be respected. You are dressing for “work”.

Remember, in general- <strong>No sweatshirts. No sneakers.</strong> <strong>Respect the dress code.</strong>

Younger kids look to you for setting the tone and example. Help them to make good choices too.

&nbsp;

<strong>Textbook Central Students</strong>

<strong>Please be advised that the textbooks you have received are signed out by barcode specifically to you.  Therefore, you will be expected to return all of your textbooks at the end of the school year, in good condition and with the barcode intact.  If you return a book which has been signed out to another student, they will get credit for the return and you will not.  You must keep track of your own textbooks throughout the school year in order to avoid being charged in June for not returning them. </strong>

<strong>Thank you.</strong>

&nbsp;
<h3><strong> Scheduling February</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>College Counselors meet with rising Seniors to plan schedules.</li>
	<li>Depts meet to review students who are currently eligible for honors/AP courses.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a community FA has made several efforts to go green and keep our school theme of sustainability. The environmental club this year has made a large effort in informing us about how we can make our community a better place. Through presentations, facts, and reusable water bottle sales, they have really made a difference.

The goal of the Environmental Club this year is to help raise awareness of the environment within the FA community. The club meets everyday to discuss new ways to achieve their goals. As a reminder to the community the environmental club has weekly Eco-tips that remind the students of little things they can do to help.

&nbsp;

So far, the club has helped put a garbage can and recycling bin in every classroom to remind the students to separate the waste. There has been an increase in the amount of garbage on campus and water bottles. This has caused the environmental club to show presentations and have a sell of reusable water bottles. The goal of the presentation was to show everyone what the plastics are doing to our environment on a global scale. The money that was raised from the water bottle sell will be used towards a big recycling container that separates sections for paper and plastic to make recycling easier for everyone. As Earth Week approaches, the environmental club is working on putting great presentations and activities for the students to participate in.

&nbsp;

The environmental clubs goal by the end of the year is to help the community make minor changes in our school to make an impact. The club is hoping that we start to take what we have learned during the school day and apply it to our outside communities and homes. The environmental club dreams that by being the begging the first link we can start a change and truly make a difference outside of our school community.

&nbsp;

As students of FA, it is our responsibility to take what we have learned and apply it by doing our part. As a community we should all try as much as possible to use a reusable water bottle and to recycle what we can. We can all do our part and start a chain to make the whole world a more eco-friendly place.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent Meetings for Worship, we have had trouble settling into silence.  Meeting for Worship is an important tradition that plays a big role in uniting our community, which is why TASQUE is concerned with maintaining the integrity of meeting. Considering that this concerns the community as a whole, TASQUE asks for your advice in addressing this issue. Please share your comments and suggestions, below, regarding ways we can better settle into silence at the start of meeting.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[We think that if more people share during meeting, then we would quiet down more so we can hear each others ideas.  Also, those who share can be rewarded  so we would want to share.  Also instead of being punished for speaking during meeting, it might be better if we offered rewards for good behavior too. Then we would look forward to sharing and receiving a reward rather than fearing that we might get punished.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This year, the Quaker Youth Leadership Conference was held at the Friends Academy campus on Long Island, New York, and was co-hosted by students and teachers from FA and the Brooklyn Friends School. The theme of the upcoming conference is “Essential Tension.” This heading encompasses the acknowledgment and examination of certain issues that apply to individual schools, in addition to the Quaker community as a whole. By “embracing” these necessary tensions, participants were able to devise appropriate ways to work with people in order to enhance their educational and social environments.

This “meeting of the minds” was a great opportunity for student leaders to converse about Quaker ideals, learn from different teachers, experience a new educational environment, meet people, and hear others’ perspectives on going to a Quaker school. There was student and teacher led discussions/workshops, a community service project, a “Coffee House” activity, and a special keynote speaker!

There were over about  140 students from 23 Quaker schools throughout the country. The 3 day excursion was a great success!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">         A few weeks ago, humanitarian Hugh Evans inspired FA students and staff with his empowering presentation about world poverty. As co-founder and CEO of the Global Poverty Project, Hugh also founded the Oaktree Foundation and was a leader in the Australian Make Poverty History campaign. In honor of his extensive international work and commitment to the betterment of global society, he was named 2004 Young Australian of the Year and 2005 Junior Chambers Young Person of the World. Hugh discovered his passion for service early in life, thanks in part to his visiting several slums in India and Thailand at the age of fifteen. He describes this experience as “having turned my world upside down;” it opened his eyes to the issue of extreme poverty and affected him profoundly. With determination, perseverance and dedication to the problems facing our world, Hugh managed to start several organizations that have gone on to impact millions of lives on a global stage, and he is hoping to impact billions more.</p>
The Global Poverty Project aims to end world poverty in our generation by motivating as many people as possible to join the cause. There are 1.4 billion people in the world living in extreme poverty, and therefore the project stresses 1.4 billion reasons to act. One of the main themes of their traveling presentation is “What can we do?” It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the size of this issue, and, especially as high school students, it seems that we individually are insignificant. However, Hugh Evans was once our age, and did not have any more connections or resources than we do. He simply took the initiative, and started small. Here is a list of a few things that we can do in our community to make a difference. They don’t require volunteer applications, have no age requirements, and do not take up hours of your already limited free time.

1) If you are ever writing an essay or doing research on the computer and happen to feel like a few minutes of procrastination is necessary, go on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">freerice.com</span></strong> (instead of playing Temple Run or Angry Birds). This website donates 10 grains of rice to hungry people in third world countries for every question you answer correctly in their interactive games. It takes about 10 seconds to rack up 100 grains of rice, so imagine what 2 minutes can do!

2) As students, Google is often our best friend, providing the answers for just about everything we need to know. Next time you need information, try <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">goodsearch.com</span></strong>. It’s a search engine powered by Yahoo that donates money to your favorite charity every time you look something up or online shop. Requiring minimal effort, it’s a very convenient way to give.

3) We all have TONS of old clothing that either doesn’t fit or is out of style. Instead of letting it just sit in the back of the closet, consider taking it to those huge clothing drop bins that are often in the parking lots of supermarkets. Better yet<strong>, Big Brother Big Sister</strong> comes to you, and collects much more than clothing to distribute to needy people in the community.

4) The holidays are a cheerful and festive time for those of us who are lucky enough to be able to fully enjoy them, but many children on Long Island go without gifts year after year. Around Christmastime, religious or social centers usually have programs in place where a family is paired with a <strong>child’s holiday wish list </strong>that cannot be fulfilled without outside help. These kids ask for simple gifts that are easy to add to the cart when you holiday shop for all of your other friends. It’s an awesome feeling to have made the holidays brighter for a needy boy or girl by simply buying one more toy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 10, the North Korean government released a statement that they have planned an amnesty of convicts in prisoner camps across the country starting on February 1.  The release of prisoners is occurring as a way to commemorate the birthdays of Kim Jong-il and Kim II-sung who ruled North Korea for 60 years. The population of about 23 million people doubts that Kim Jong Un will make any drastic changes, therefore the amnesty is another attempt to gain popularity for the new ruler and appease the public.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-930" title="1" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1-292x300.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="300" /></a>

It is predicted that in the camps there are 200,000 political prisoners, but the government has not said how many they plan to release or what crimes will be pardoned.  North Korea usually releases prisoners every five years to celebrate important occasions.  The last time prisoners were released was in August 2005 to celebrate the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Koreas freedom from Japan’s colonial rule.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-931" title="2" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

Although there will be a number of prisoners released, United States investigators claim that the ratio of free people to prisoners will remain the same. This is the case because often times following an amnesty, many people are imprisoned; therefore, the percentage of prisoners will be maintained. Recently, Washington met in Pyongyang to discuss ways to prevent food shortages and to start nuclear disarmament.  If the third generation of Kim dynasty continues to rule, change may not be possible with Kim Jong Un trying to fill his father’s very big shoes.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blogging Now Considered &quot;Therapeutic&quot; for Teenagers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The old school but classic “Dear Diary” cliché has now turned into blogs full of fashion, quotes, friends, and teenage stresses.  Today, thousands of teenagers are turning towards online blogging as a way to relieve daily stresses and get support from friends about typical troubles.  For many years, psychologists have spoken about the benefits teenagers received by writing down their woes.  However, today researchers are saying that blogging is even more effective because it allows kids to receive feedback from their peers.

In a recent study, Meyran Boniel-Nissim and Azy Barak, psychology professors at the University of Haifa in Israel, found that the kids who were blogging and allowing their posts and pictures to be commented on had the most mood improvement.  The professors split 161 girls and boys into six groups and asked them to create blogs.  Two groups were asked to write about social difficulties with one group allowing their posts to be commented on.  Two groups were asked to post about anything they wanted to write about with one group allowing comments from their friends.  The last two groups were told to keep an old-fashioned diary or do nothing at all.  The most spirits were lifted in the group that blogged about their problems and allowed their posts to be commented on.  For the most part, the professors saw that most comments were supportive and suggestive about how to resolve the blogger’s problems.

Websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr allow people to upload pictures, write about what they are doing, and show their friends/followers what they like and enjoy doing.  The “newer” technologic world has allowed kids to understand each other more and become closer.  Although many people say that teens are spending way too much time online, the many benefits are slowly being proven.

		<title>Peace Week at FA</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2012/03/04/peace-week-at-fa/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Peace Week at FA is a time where the entire school comes together to learn about and discuss a global issue. We adjust our weekly schedule and use assembly and PE blocks, as well as meeting for worship and advisory as a time to listen to speakers, watch videos, and educate ourselves on the matter. We also split up into peace groups which is a treat, as it is one of the only times our entire school, lower, middle and upper gets together as a whole. This year the topic of peace week was poverty.

Peace week began on Tuesday, with an upper school gathering in the theater. TASQUE opened the assembly by reciting a query regarding poverty, which was followed by a slide presentation. The slide show was a great way to give the students a general background of the amount of people poverty affects globally.

On Wednesday upper school students split up into paired advisories, where we watched two videos teaching us about poverty throughout the United States; the first video discussed the affect that the recession has had on our country’s rate of unemployment, and the difficulty of finding work in such a tough economy. The second video discussed children in poverty, and how hard it is to go to school when after going to bed hungry and trying to study without electricity. Following the videos we had to fill out a questionnaire educating us on the different cultures, ages and races struggling with poverty throughout the United States. Many Students were surprised to find out that the majority of impoverished people throughout the United States were of white descent.

Thursday was the highlight of Peace Week for many of the upper school students. We were given the opportunity to hear an outstanding speaker named Hugh Evans teach us about global poverty, as well as ways to fix it. Hugh Evans is the CEO of the Global Poverty project, and one of the key leaders behind the Make Poverty History campaign. Often, students feel that they are informed of global issues, but are not given the resources to help end the problem. Hugh Evans, however, did just that. He told us that individually we can all make a big difference by spreading awareness, visiting his global poverty project website, donating to our favorite organizations, personally getting involved in service on a local level and purchasing fair trade products. Fair trade is both a social movement, and a market-based approach that aspires to support producers in developing countries to make better trading conditions, as well as promote sustainability. The goal of the movement is to advocate for higher payments to exporters, and higher social and environmental standards.  Be sure to look for the symbol on packages signifying that the item is fair trade.

&nbsp;

On our final day of Peace Week we met in our peace groups in the gym. We participated in an activity where we “shared how we let our lives speak through service.” We also were lucky enough to listen to two FA alumni’s speak about their experience with service and how they try to end poverty. Michael Fox is involved with “Humanitainment,” which is an organization that produces “mini-political movies” that blend entertainment with political awareness. Courtney Lenoir started the organization, Generation Y Not, which reaches out in creative ways to raise community awareness and assist grassroots organizations working to change the face of poverty, education, disease, peace and social justice around the world. Michael Fox ’91 and Courtney Lenoir ’10 have two very different experiences with service but have both dedicated their lives to making the world a better place.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Waiting on your hands and knees in anticipation, ready for your time to shine. All eyes are on you! The pressure’s on! The official yells “set” and the sound of the gun goes pop! You’re off as your body propels in the air off your starting block. You’re running, running, running as fast as you can for your one shot to win the gold!</em>

FA’s Winter Track season has been victorious. From the start, each runner has worked their hardest to achieve their personal goals, and represent Friends Academy well.

This season’s team has welcomed both new and veteran runners, who have all been able to experience the sport of track and field together. Thanks to our hard work and the great coaching staff, Franklin Thompson and Lauren Cabrallo, many runners have had the opportunity to run in numerous track meets, such as the St. Anthony’s Format A-D meets, the Hispanic Games, Conference Championships, the Yale Invitational, County Championships, and soon to come the State Qualifier meet. Our girls’ team came in first at the Conference Championships, where the girls 4x800 team was awarded the fastest 4x800 team in the county. Our boys’ team also did well, coming in seventh out of nineteen, very competitive schools. The team as a whole came in fourth at the County Championships.

[nggallery id=14]

Although we are approaching the end of our season, our road to victory has not yet been completed. Two of the teams runners, Candace Taylor (’14) and Kelsey Margey (’12) and Shekinah Pettway ('14) will move on to compete at the State meet at Cornell University.

When speaking to individual players and the whole team I learned that all of the runners felt that the season was successful, and the new runners enjoyed the  exposure to a new sport. Simmy, a new member to the team, said “The season was a lot of fun. I was able to make new friends at the meets and during practice. The workouts also helped me become a better runner and become more successful at the meets” (Simmmy Ghooi ’15). I also had the opportunity to talk to veteran, Candace, who said that “Everyone had a good season. I enjoyed it as well and the meets were exciting and it was great to run against other competitors.” (Candace Taylor ’14)

<strong>Congratulations to the Winter Track and Field Team!</strong> Make sure to wish Candace and Kelsey good luck in their upcoming competition!

<strong>And Congratulations to Conference 6 Coach of the Year FA's very own Franklin Thompson!</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is 10 seconds to go in the game and the game is tied at 40/40. FA has the ball and one chance to make a basket to win the game. There are five seconds left and...score! A lay-up is made, giving the FA boys the win and allowing them to be tied for first in their conference! The Boys Friends Academy Varsity Basketball team put their all into every practice, and their hard work showed through in their games. FA students, freshman to seniors, enjoyed watching all of their games and cheering for such a hard-working and talented team. An Interview with Coach Hefele will provide more details about the season:

1. What was the biggest highlight of the season so far? We have had some ups and downs to date, but our last game vs. Locust Valley might have been our best effort so far. We pulled out a tough win to pull in to a tie for 1st place in our conference with LV and Malverne. It was also Sr. Night and there was a great crowd that created a great game atmosphere.
2. What are some of your expectations of the teams for playoffs? We will play East Rockaway next Sun (2/19) at 3pm at CW Post. We follow the girls’ game at 1:00. We have played well against the Rocks this season, but realize it is hard to defeat a quality opponent 3 times in one season. They are playing well of late and we will have to be prepared in order to advance.
3. How has the team improved since the beginning of the season? It is always difficult to get all the pieces of the puzzle to fit together, but we do seem to be getting a better understanding of our roles and the consistent effort it takes to be successful. We have also started to play with a better understanding of our offensive and defensive concepts. If we continue to play Hard, Smart, and Together; we have the potential to compete with the stronger "C" schools out there.

4. Were there any goals that you and the team set for the season? If so, what where they and have they been meet? Our goals are centered around working hard every day to get better and helping our teammates to do the same in order to reach our potential. We constantly work to understand that the team comes first and work on the little things that lead to success. There are many skills that go unnoticed in basketball that are critical to being a solid team. Communication on the floor, helping your teammates, and staying positive are just a few that we work on every day.

5. Is there one game or a few games in particular that you can say was a difficult game or a victorious win? The first game against Locust Valley was very disappointing as we failed to execute together as a team and lost our poise. That loss carried over into the next game as we had a poor effort against Cold Spring Harbor. However, we have bounced back with a solid run through the back half of our schedule and put ourselves in good position to finish the season up strong.

The boys have had a great season holding the record with 12 wins, and only 4 losses. Unfortunately, the boys lost to East Rockaway in the County Championship, where they played a great game and hung on until the very end. FA fans will be disappointed as the boys were so much fun to watch; however, it has been a great and exciting run. Congratulations to the boys Varsity team for winning their conference and coming this far!

		<title>Friends Football Receives Some Big Offseason News</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friends Academy Football received big news this winter: Nassau County Section VIII (8) Athletics will be creating a Developmental League for seven football teams, including the Quakers, to make games closer for everyone involved. The league is intended to help the following teams rebuild their failing programs: Port Washington, Jericho, Great Neck North, Great Neck South, Roslyn, Friends Academy, and Long Island Lutheran (LuHi did not participate in the public school league last year; similarly Friends did not field an official varsity team). Hopefully the league will influence and encourage more students at all seven schools to play football.

The five teams that did play in the public school league went a combined 5-35 last year, with several winless teams. Nassau Football Coordinator Pat Pizzarelli said that if a team dominates, it will move back to its conference; but because the league will not feature postseason play, determining if a team is ready to move back to its conference is a difficult task. The league features teams from all divisions (Friends academy is Section VIII Division IV, while Port Washington is Section VIII Division I, and LuHi is in a separate Private School division. Public School Divisions are based on school size not team skill level).

Whether or not the league will be successful is yet to be seen, but Nassau County has had a Developmental League before; the six-team Island Conference was used in 1991, before Friends Academy participated in public school athletics. The league does have its flaws, however. Many of the Divisions in Nassau County have 2 and 3 win teams, which are dependent on the other weak teams for their limited success. Without these teams, a new bottom tier of teams will likely develop. The only legitimate way developmental teams can find new success in their old divisions is if, before returning, they see significant increases in participation or they follow in the footsteps of current successful teams.

The other controversial aspect of the league is the inclusion of Long Island Lutheran. As a private school, LuHi has no restrictions on recruiting, and can offer benefits to athletes that public school teams cannot. LuHi has also had mediocre success in Private School competition, making competitors nervous that they will dominate the new league. Regardless of the league's flaws, at least some of these traditionally losing programs will be successful next year, and Friends is expected to come out strong. Hopefully the new league boosts FA Football student participation and success.

		<title>The Top 5 Places to go in 2012</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">This past year may not have seemed like the most ideal time to travel because of  worldwide economic slumps. However, statistics show that the percentage of Americans who traveled 50 miles or more in the 2011-2012 holiday break was about 30%, up 1.4% from last year. That translates to 91.9 million Americans hitting the roads, seas and skies- the second highest amount in the past decade.</p>
Where exactly does everyone go? AOL compiled a top five list of 2011’s hottest destinations, spanning several continents and remote corners of the globe. Whether or not you have visited one of these places on your holiday break, their rising popularity among tourists can definitely give you something to think about when planning a future vacation.

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>1.    </strong><strong>New York, New York</strong></li>
</ol>
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Vista_a%C3%A9rea_de_Times_Square_desde_el_Empire_State_Building.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="Vista aérea de Times Square desde el Empire State Building.jpg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Vista_a%C3%A9rea_de_Times_Square_desde_el_Empire_State_Building.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="277" /></a>

A perennial top ten pick, New York City is definitely the place to be for shopping, fashion, theater, art and culture. With a tremendous range of things to do and see, it is impossible to be bored. In addition, several landmarks are reaching milestone anniversaries: the Statue of Liberty turned 125, Carnegie Hall celebrated its 120<sup>th</sup> birthday, and the National 9/11 Memorial recently opened, just in time to mark the tenth anniversary of the tragic attacks. Thanks to the hotel boom of 2010, room capacity has increased by nearly 20%, so there is now more space for everyone to enjoy what the Big Apple has to offer. We’re lucky to live so close to such an amazing city!

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>2.    </strong><strong>London</strong></li>
</ol>
<div><strong><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Clock_Tower_-_Palace_of_Westminster%2C_London_-_September_2006.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="Clock Tower - Palace of Westminster, London - September 2006.jpg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Clock_Tower_-_Palace_of_Westminster%2C_London_-_September_2006.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="428" /></a></strong></div>
Between the royal wedding last spring and the anticipation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, London is bustling. Always a center for world-renown architecture, museums and theater, the city also comes alive with glamorous nightlife. Whatever your interests, London has plenty of things to do and see.

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>3.    </strong><strong>Doha, Qatar</strong></li>
</ol>
<div><strong><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/DohaSkyline_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="DohaSkyline 2.jpg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/DohaSkyline_2.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="277" /></a></strong></div>
Pretty far away, but totally worth it! Doha is the capital city of Qatar,

a country on the Persian gulf. Known for its incredible beaches, restaurants and nightlife, it has all of the attractions without the over-the-top glitz of Dubai. Beautiful hotels and waterfront promenades intermix with historic minarets for a scene that cannot be missed. Last but not least, The Pearl, encompassing at least 13 amazing artificial islands, is slowly opening with a planned 154 square miles of deluxe residences, hotels, dining and shopping. Definitely an unforgettable vacation.

<strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>       4.   St. Kitts and Nevis</strong>

<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASt.Kitts_and_Nevis_-Two_Islands_One_Paradise.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="St.Kitts and Nevis -Two Islands One Paradise.jpg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/St.Kitts_and_Nevis_-Two_Islands_One_Paradise.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="277" /></a>

St. Kitts and Nevis are sister islands located in the Leeward islands; it is a federal two-island nation in the West Indies. Lush rainforests, rich history and exquisite renovated plantations are all parts of this paradise. St. Kitts, the larger island of the two, boasts great hiking and diving as well as reasonably-priced places to stay. The Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean meet by St. Kitts’ narrowest point, which is also home to fun beach bars. Some major new developments, including a Tom Fazio golf course, are under way for 2012 and are definitely going to be popular attractions.

&nbsp;

<strong> </strong>

<strong>       5.    Atlanta, Georgia</strong>

<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Fabulous_Fox_Theater_and_nearby_hotels.JPG"><img class="alignnone" title="Fabulous Fox Theater and nearby hotels.JPG" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Fabulous_Fox_Theater_and_nearby_hotels.JPG" alt="" width="310" height="237" /></a>

An expanding hotel scene and many activities make Atlanta a new hot spot. A Legoland Discovery center, Pirate museum, and state-of-the-art dolphin exhibit at the Georgia Aquarium are set to open this year, so Atlanta is the perfect place for a family getaway. Other attractions in the city include the World of Coca-Cola and a top-notch zoo. There are plenty of places to party and dine at night, especially in Midtown. Although you may not expect Atlanta to be much of a social and leisure destination, it is quickly becoming one of America’s most fashionable cities.]]></content:encoded>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you haven’t heard of Jeremy Lin yet, you have obviously been living under a rock for the past few months. The twenty-three year old is one of the few Asians in the NBA and the first of Taiwanese descent – he is arguably the most famous already. His rapid rise to fame has often been called a “Linderella” story: although he led his high school team to capture the California Interscholastic Federation Division II state title, he was not offered any athletic scholarships from colleges, including his dream school Stanford. However, his 4.2 GPA and competitive performance convinced Harvard to guarantee him a spot on its basketball team. After graduating, Lin signed a two-year deal with his home team, the Golden State Warriors. He did not receive much playing time, but the Asian-American community in San Francisco experienced a state of frenzied excitement. The New York Knicks later claimed Lin off waivers as a backup in December. A combination of injuries and poor performance on the team allowed Lin his debut. His skill, novelty, and diligence propelled his NBA career from that point forward. Jeremy Lin is now worth $14 million, he has been on the cover of <em>Times</em> as often as Michael Jordan, and throughout all the fame, he has remained, according to his teammates and friends, humble and grounded.

It makes a good story, doesn’t it? Everyone from sports commentators to Ben &amp; Jerry’s seems to believe so; they have delighted in how much material he provides them. Lincredible, Linferno, Linderella, and most well-known of all – Linsanity, are only a few of the portmanteaus that have been created in honor of Jeremy Lin. Perhaps the only characteristic exploited more often than his name is his race.

Jeremy Lin is breaking every Asian stereotype. His existence is proof against the assumption that Asians can only succeed on the academic level. While he does set an example for potential Asian athletes, Jeremy Lin considers himself a basketball player first. However, many seem intent on perpetuating the negative connotations and stereotypes of his race. Ben &amp; Jerry’s certainly jumped on the bandwagon, creating “Taste the Lin-sanity” – a frozen yogurt that includes pieces of fortune cookies. The ice cream company has since replaced the fortune cookies with waffles and has apologized for any perceived disrespect or offense. After distasteful headlines such as “An Asian Who Knows How to Drive” and “Chink in Armor” have graced the Internet and our newspaper stands, the Asian American Journalists Association has felt it necessary to step in. It released guidelines on how to report on Jeremy Lin:

<strong><em>DANGER ZONES</em></strong><em></em>

<strong><em>"CHINK":</em></strong><em> Pejorative; do not use in a context involving an Asian person on someone who is Asian American. Extreme care is needed if using the well-trod phrase "chink in the armor"; be mindful that the context does not involve Asia, Asians or Asian Americans. (The appearance of this phrase with regard to Lin led AAJA MediaWatch to issue statement to ESPN, which subsequently disciplined its employees.)</em>

<strong><em>DRIVING:</em></strong><em> This is part of the sport of basketball, but resist the temptation to refer to an "Asian who knows how to drive."</em>

<strong><em>EYE SHAPE:</em></strong><em> This is irrelevant. Do not make such references if discussing Lin's vision.</em>

<strong><em>FOOD:</em></strong><em> Is there a compelling reason to draw a connection between Lin and fortune cookies, takeout boxes or similar imagery? In the majority of news coverage, the answer will be no.</em>

<strong><em>MARTIAL ARTS:</em></strong><em> You're writing about a basketball player. Don't conflate his skills with judo, karate, tae kwon do, etc. Do not refer to Lin as "Grasshopper" or similar names associated with martial-arts stereotypes.”</em>

And so on. Clearly Jeremy Lin has been made into the representative of Asians worldwide, without regard to his own feelings or to the fact that he is a native-born American. However, his Taiwanese roots can also be viewed in a positive manner. He has become an inspiration to the Asian community worldwide. China has claimed him as one of its own, despite his Taiwanese-American roots. As a Chinese-American myself, I believe the best way to illustrate the effect of Jeremy Lin on my household is to relate a recent experience.

This President’s week, my family and I flew to California to visit Stanford. Once on campus, my father immediately commented, “They must be kicking themselves for letting Jeremy Lin slip through their fingers.” I possessed not a modicum of interest in professional sports, but after enduring a six-hour flight with my father pontificating on the player, I was reasonably more informed about Jeremy Lin and utterly sick of him already. After our tour, we pulled in at a nearby shopping center that happened to be directly across from Palo Alto High School. I awaited the outburst with  resignation.

“Jeremy Lin’s high school!” my father exclaimed breathlessly, “This may be the only opportunity for me to take a picture; you probably won’t be admitted to Stanford, so it will the last time we are in California.”

Letting the insult slide, I observed his tight grip on the camera, decided the argument was not worth it, and informed him that my mother, sister, and I would be in Rite Aid if he needed us. Browsing through the pharmacy’s array of allergy medication, I turned around to face my mother.

“I really don’t understand why he’s so obsessed. Last time I checked, Dad was more of a golf-”

My words died on my lips as I took in the bizarre sight: my mother was holding and actually reading a Sports Illustrated magazine (!) with none other than Jeremy Lin on the cover.

All I could muster was a pathetic, “But you don’t even like sports.”

“This boy is really great,” she informed me without looking up. “Did you know that he went to Harvard? Did you know that he is Christian? Did you know that the coaches didn’t even let him play at first?”

My mother finally raised her head and said earnestly, “He would make a great role model for you, Victoria.”

I recognized that excited expression and those half-glazed eyes with a sense of defeat. My family, like the rest of the world, had officially succumbed to Linsanity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How would you feel eating a piece of steak that was grown in a laboratory? A new technique being developed by scientists allows the removal of muscle cells  from an animal painlessly through a small needle.  The cells are cultivated in a Petri dish that is the same temperature as the animal the cell was extracted from. When the cell sits in the Petri dish it is provided with glucose, amino acids, and minerals.  To keep the cells stimulated and growing the “meat batter” is stretched to imitate exercise on large plastic sheets.  After a certain amount of time, a thin piece of meat is peeled off the sheet and rolled into hamburger meat.

Jason Matheny, a college professor at the University of Maryland is leading the project.  As a vegetarian, his hope is that the entire world will eventually be supplied with this meat and animal cruelty will be cut out of the picture.

When asked, most vegetarians said that they would not switch back to eating meat regardless of how it was made.  However, they were excited by this method of getting meat for nonvegetarians.  Scientifically simulating meats would allow people who eat meat to continue to do so but remove the factor of animal cruelty.  The world’s largest animal rights organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have coined and are promoting the term “murderless meat.”

The advantages of meat made through technology are significant.  40 billion animals are killed for food each year.  If the number of factory farm animals decreases, the amount of water and land pollution caused by animal waste would be greatly reduced too.  Many common health problems that are acquired through meat eating would be reduced like mad cow disease and avian flu.  The antibiotics, steroids, and chemicals that meats contain won’t be a problem anymore.  Meat made through this technological process will not have fat or can be replaced with a healthier fat.

Nutritionists are stressing the idea that if America doesn’t cut down on it’s meat consumption, a healthier country with less disease won’t be a possibility. In small amounts it is a good source of protein but not the excessive amounts that are bought or served in restaurants throughout the United States.

Recently, the Dutch have invested $5 million to “grow” pork via stem cells.  Scientists think that ground meat could be produced within six years if they can amass sufficient funding.  Right now, it costs $5,000 to produce just one pound of meat! If the demand for the product goes down though, the price could be cut to a thousand times less.  Although some people feel that this meat is too synthetic and just plain weird, the reality is that the food is not artificial. The only difference between this murderless meat and regular meat is that animals won’t have to be killed.

Many commonly eaten foods are man-made, like cheese, wine, and tofu.  Despite what some people may think, this process is very different than cloning.  The cells that produce the meat are the same type that we produce when we exercise.  If we were cloning the meat, germ line cells would be grown and the meat would then be fake.

As of now, taste, cost, safety, nutrition, and how willing consumers would be to try something new, stands in the way of the murderless meat’s success.  People may never want to eat meat that was created in a tube but scientists will never know until they try.  Who knows, maybe in a few years machines like bread makers will produce meat overnight.  Think about that sitting on your kitchen countertop!

		<title>The Long-Awaited New Cell Phone Policy</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2012/03/21/the-long-awaited-new-cell-phone-policy/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As students and teenagers, we all know how important our cell phones are to us. Right now, it is clear that the very restrictive policy on cellphones is not being enforced by teachers or followed by the students. As a result, Student Faculty Board is trying to make a policy more consistent with what is actually happening during school.

As of the 2012 school year, students now have the ability to view their schedules, check their school email, take notes,  jot down homework, and access other important school-related materials on their cell phones, iPads, and computers. SFB argues that since mobile devices are being used in the same ways that computers are being used by students, cells phones should be allowed in the places that students can use their computers in.

The new proposal states that students should be allowed to use their phones in school, in the same way that they can use their computers. The non-voice capabilities of phones would only be allowed to be utilized in the library and the social spaces, and the current restrictions on voice capabilities would remain the same.

In terms of taking notes on a phone or using it in class, the rules would be the same as they are for a computer. The ability to use the computers in the classroom is up to the teachers. These devices can only be used with the teacher's consent.

SFB has approved this proposal and it has passed through the head advisors and is onto the full faculty for approval. The Head Faculty is currently discussing the topic and will bring it back to the SFB when they are finished. There is the possibility that the new set of rules will not pass, but with the increasing impact of technology in student's lives, it seems a compromise would be more beneficial.

The new policy, if passed, would take place immediately following the decision. There will be a process though, that may include a trial period to see how the students handle the privilege of using their phones appropriately. There is no set time for when the decision will be made. It could potentially happen as early as this year.

It is assumed that all students will follow and respect the spirit of the new policy. It is an exciting discussion that will hopefully result in the great outcome that everybody is hoping for.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Caffeine Isn&#039;t All Bad</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dunkin Donuts is correct; our country does in fact "run on" coffee. We use it to wake up in the mornings, pull through our post-lunch crashes, and enable ourselves to stay up for all night cram sessions. However, how many people actually know how it works? Not many.  With so many myths, and so many studies, it is easy to get mixed up with what caffeine actually does. This is why whenever I mention I drink coffee, I get angry stares from adults who equate caffeine consumption to heroin addiction.

Caffeine is the chemical in coffee responsible for its effects. The reason that it helps to keep you awake is that it disrupts your body’s ability to sense exhaustion, thus letting you finish that 10-page term paper due in the morning. Caffeine is, in fact, a drug. In high dosages over prolonged periods, it can cause physical and psychological dependency, and can be lethal at extremely high doses. However, to <em>actually</em> get addicted, you would need to drink 6-7 cups a day, and to die you would need around 100 cups.  Caffeine can also cause jitteriness, inability to sleep, and because it is a diuretic, it makes you pee a lot. Despite these side effects, coffee has many redeeming qualities.

Coffee is great because it contains many antioxidants. It also has been proven in studies to lower the risks of certain kinds of cancers (conversely, it raises the risks of others, but you can’t have your cake and eat it too.) It has been shown to lower chances of depression, help treat asthma, and improve athletic performance. The list of the benefits of coffee go on and on, and while high dosages can have some unpleasant consequences,<strong> reasonable</strong> amounts of caffeine in your system will not stunt your growth, make you lose all of your hair or whatever other myths are out there. However, the key word here is  <strong>reasonable</strong>. If you're having 6 cups a day, maybe you need to cut back just a tad.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Recession Hits Students</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An 18 year old is not expected to finance a home. A high school senior is not supposed to navigate the world of banking. No one could say that a teenager can determine how much he can afford to borrow today based on assumptions of how much he will be able to pay back in the future. Yet that’s precisely what most high school juniors and seniors are expected to do when they decide to go to college; especially during what economists refer to as the worst economy since the Great Depression. College is unreasonably expensive-even at public colleges and universities. The prolonged economic downturn includes extended unemployment at 8.3% of the workforce, and that number doesn’t even include employed workers who are underemployed by cutbacks, furloughs, downsizing, and job-sharing. Consequently, many families are struggling to keep their homes, and for some, keeping a roof over their heads is a daily struggle. So the costs of college are likely to be at the bottom of most families' lists of priorities, but a determined high school student must find a way to get into college-even when his parents can't afford to help.

The recession has left high school students and their families unable to pay for college; many families can't afford college and incredibly, even those employed and struggling, can earn “too much money” to qualify for government grants and other financial assistance. Grant money isn’t readily available; government cutbacks over the last decade have chipped away at government resources to fund colleges— even now, politicians are campaigning for the White House on the platform of “personal responsibility” and the downsizing of government financing. That downsizing has eroded the available resources for the basics—higher education, housing and healthcare. Further exacerbating the predicament of prospective college attendees, the private bank loans that used to be available for education have all but disappeared.

In 2010, the New York Times reported that more than 41% of high school students stated that the cost of a college is critical to their selection of the school; and almost half (44.7%) said that the college’s offer of any financial aid was critical—that was a 12.5% increase in less than three years. But more relevant to students than the financial aid and cost was what kinds of jobs, or if any jobs were available to a college graduate after college. 56.5% of students selected schools based upon the college’s ability to help get them a job after graduation.

Instead of going to college to learn everything he can, a student is compelled, in this expensive and uncertain world, to consider what his college degree (and major) will train him to do after college. In 2011, college guide books (www.mycollegeguide.com) recommended that a major in engineering is always useful and sellable in the workforce. Healthcare related majors and computer science were also strongly recommended. The reasoning behind those suggestions is that the American population is aging; a healthcare profession will be a long-lasting career; as to computer science, in this day and age with the new digital world, computer science is indispensible.

The recession has necessarily infiltrated each and every high school. Instead of enjoying life and the social and educational opportunities that high school offers, more and more students are confronted with the brutal realities of cost, debt, employment and pay back. It’s a shame that college selection and studies have also been impacted by the recession and that students can't enjoy learning for the sake of learning before they become adults and thrown into the adult world. Instead, they must navigate the enigmatic world of government and private loans, and financial aid, and choose a major based on professional opportunity rather than interest.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>SOL - Student Organization of Latinos</strong>

<strong>Interview with Kirsten Loscalzo</strong>

LEADERS:
Erika Vidal
Matt Kuczmarski
Kirsten Loscalzo

MISSION: The Student Organization of Latinos raises awareness about Spanish culture and supports Hispanic organizations from South America to Spain.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS: SOL has coordinated periodic lunchtime quesadilla sales, the annual pencil drive, Books for Costa Rica, the Día de los Muertos fundraiser, and donations to the Boys and Girls Club and to the Centro de Educación Creativa en Monteverde (CECM).

CLOUD FOREST SCHOOL: The proceeds from the quesadilla sales and the books and pencils from the drives go to the Cloud Forest School in Costa Rica. The Cloud Forest School not only educates its young students but also instills in them the importance of conservation and preservation. Instead of cutting down the “one-of-a-kind tropical forest”, the children are taught many languages so that they may become tour guides and earn livelihoods through ecotourism. SOL has already sent over three hundred books to the Cloud Forest students to aid them in their efforts.

MEMBERS: Members of SOL should come regularly to Wednesday meetings, work at the sales, and encourage Friends Academy participation in events and drives.

MEETINGS: SOL meetings are held in Mr. Posada’s room during Wednesday assembly blocks.    JOIN: To become a part of the club, just attend a meeting. Why join? As Senior Kirsten Loscalzo puts it, “SOL is a lot of fun! Quesadillas are yummy and leadership positions are always available for dedicated members!”

To learn more about the Cloud Forest school, go to http://cloudforestschool.org.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you wondering what will be in style this spring?  Look no further than the runways of designers such as Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste, and Peter Som. These designers have focused on a nautical theme and the American colors of red white and blue for this spring. Bold stripes and plaid prints dominate the preppy aspect of their spring collections. Dresses and skirts are a must have for spring but rugby’s never seem to be forgotten as they are still being featured in Lacoste’s spring line.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/lacoste.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1384 alignnone" title="lacoste" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/lacoste.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="324" /></a>                                                                             <a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/preppy-TH.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1386" title="preppy TH" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/preppy-TH.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="326" /></a>

(Lacoste: Rugby style dress)                                                                                             (Tommy Hilfiger: Nautical/preppy print)

The easiest way to achieve these runway looks is to wear knee-length skirts paired with crew necks or collared shirts.

		<title>This Past Winter: Global Warming, or Natural Cycle?</title>

Every ski shop in town is having sales because the mittens, gloves and scarves were rarely used. The weathermen, usually armed with some winter calamity to report, seemed a bit bored. And fathers were relieved to see only a light brush of snow had grazed their drive ways.

It is no secret that Long Island experienced a strangely snowless winter this year. With about 3 inches as the maximum accumulation from December to March, some breathe a sigh of relief, while others lament the lack of snowdays and sledding. However, most of us are left wondering: Is this mild winter a sign of global warming? If it is, how do we explain the extreme arctic conditions that hit Europe? Is this all part of some crazy weather pattern, or just part of our planet’s natural cycle?

According to the National Climatic Data Center, temperatures across the United States this winter were the fourth warmest on record since 1895. However, they are quick to point out that while winter temperatures across the lower 48 states have been increasing at about 0.16 degrees Fahrenheit per decade, this change is not significant enough to cause such visible warming for one season. There are numerous global patterns and trends that can drive weather across a region of the globe from year to year. The presence of La Niña in the Equatorial Pacific, the North Atlantic Oscillation in the North Atlantic, and the Arctic Oscillation across the High Latitudes were all factors that definitely contributed to this past winter’s unusual conditions.

Online blogs and chat forums discussing this winter’s weather also agree with the statement that the mild temperatures do not necessarily point to climate change. One blogger recalled the winters of 1972 and 1974, when snow was scarce and did not cause a single school cancellation (sounds familiar). 1977, however, proved to be much colder. Weather cycles also vary greatly from state to state, city to city. Southern regions sometimes get more snow than their northern counterparts, depending on the path of particular storms and the location of large urban areas, which are usually several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside.

Just in case anyone still believes that our mild winter was a direct result of global warming, take a look at Europe’s deep freeze. Some seasonal highlights included the closing of waterways in Turkey due to heavy snow, icy weather in subtropical Greece, and frozen canals in Italy. Unfortunately, unprecedented precipitation and sub-zero temperatures led to several deaths across the hardest-hit areas, including Ukraine, Romania and Poland.

Whether you were thrilled or disappointed by this winter’s mild forecast, don’t expect the same thing next year. The unpredictability of long-range weather patterns means that we will have to keep speculating about what exactly we will be facing in the months ahead. But one thing is pretty obvious: don’t sell your snow blower just yet.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cancer is caused by an uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in almost any part of the body. Unfortunately, this disease affects many people around the world. Some are lucky enough to overcome cancer and continue their lives, but hundreds of thousands of people lose their fight to the disease every year in the US alone. In order to support cancer survivors and victims, the FA Student Life Committee has coordinated the Relay for Life Fundraiser that will take place at our school.

Relay for Life is a fundraiser run by the American Cancer Society. It is a walk held over the course of one night, symbolizing the fact that cancer never sleeps. Relay for Life is ONE NIGHT, ONE FIGHT, and ONE COMMUNITY that has come together to fight the battle against cancer.

The FA Student Life Committee has worked hard to bring Relay for Life to Friends Academy. The idea stemmed from a Student Life Committee meeting that took place four years ago. During this meeting, one student stood up to question why Friends Academy, being such a tight community, had not yet come together to raise money and awareness of cancer. After the meeting, two students, Lizzie Birnbaum and Gabrielle Aaron, took on this challenge. At their suggestion, hosting a Relay for Life event was considered and eventually approved, allowing for the actual preparations to begin.

Friends Academy’s Relay for Life will be different than others'. The community’s teams will be based on grouped advisories and peace groups. The night will be full of fun games and exciting entertainment. As of now, we have a lot of great bands scheduled to play throughout the night. The Student Life Committee will also be serving dinner, dessert, and breakfast. The night will be Western themed, and participants are encouraged to dress up. Also, because no Western themed gathering is complete without it, there will be the famous mechanical bull ride. In the middle of the night, there will be a "Clash of the Classes," in which the high schoolers will compete against each other as grades. More importantly, however, this celebration will be to honor those who lost their battle with cancer or are still fighting, while giving the community the opportunity to come together in support of a worthy cause.

The Student Life Committee hopes that all students and their families sign up and even ask outside friends to do so as well. This should be an outstanding occasion that will be remembered and hopefully continued as a tradition within the FA community.  Come out and help make a difference in the fight against cancer!

		<title>Rihanna and Chris Brown: Chaos to Controversy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Made public in 2007, Rihanna and Chris Brown’s relationship added to the tremendous media attention and success the two had lately been enjoying. Fans called it a “match made in heaven,” as the two R&amp;B stars were young, attractive and at the top of their game. However, things are not always as they seem: in 2009, Brown was charged with assault after violently and repeatedly punching Rihanna during a fight in his Lamborghini. As his career plummeted and Rihanna struggled to get back on her feet, the music industry and fans of both singers tried to make sense of the event. Through the chaos and confusion the incident had caused, most were sure of the fact that the Barbados-born beauty and “Breezy” would never talk again, let alone collaborate on music. Well, proving again that most things in the celebrity world are incredibly temporary, Rihanna and Chris Brown recently released a couple of new songs, which are co-written, co-performed, and anything but conservative.

“Turn Up the Music” is a catchy dance beat that is mostly Brown’s own work. Rihanna joins him about halfway through the song, singing her own verse and then acting as a background voice until the end. It is just a typical, fun club song, probably requiring little emotional attachment on the part of either artist. Jennifer Lopez and B.O.B could definitely have done just as good of a job. “Birthday Cake,” on the other hand, is a different story. Sung mostly by Rihanna with Brown on side vocals, there isn’t really a single line that is appropriate enough to be featured in an Inkwell article. Nor is it right for a dance studio, T.V. show, almost all radio stations….even playing the ‘unclean’ version at a club would be very bold, to say the least. A song like this requires some degree of comfort between the two performers; it would otherwise be extremely awkward for everyone involved. Well, maybe Nicki Minaj would do it.

Besides provocative songs and rumors of a “secret” (not really because everyone knows about it) relationship, other clues point to a renewed romance between Rihanna and Chris Brown. News has been leaking that the two might be sharing the stage for a duet at the SupaFest music festival in Brisbane, Australia this summer. While the international community seems to have gotten over the violent incident that led to the singers’ split, fans in the US are still a little apprehensive about them being together. However, as new, upbeat collaborations by Rihanna and Chris catch on, my feeling is that the events of the past will soon be forgotten-- one iTunes download at a time.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mass Effect 3: A Mass Failure?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>To all those who have not played the game: Spoilers ahead.</strong></em>

Mass Effect 3 is the finale of the Mass Effect trilogy, and as the conclusion to such an epic series, fans expected it to be <em>epic. </em>Was it an epic conclusion? This is the question that has divided the gaming community, causing arguments in forums, reaction videos on YouTube, and angry Facebook posts (I myself am actually guilty of leaving an angry post on BioWare's Facebook page) over the endings.  However, after a second play through, I realized that giving the game a rating of a 2.5 just because of the ending is not fair. I believe the entire BioWare team, just as it deserves a slap in the face for the endings, deserves credit for every other aspect of the game, which was almost perfect.

The voice acting was amazing; the graphics were excellent; and the cleverness of this script surpassed those of the past two games, something I did not think could be done. To top it all off, the musical score to this game has to be the best musical score I have ever heard. Don't get me wrong, the scores to Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 were excellent. However, the music for Mass Effect 3 conveys an incredibly complex combination of determination, desperation, and fear in a way I had not previously thought possible. Prior to playing this game I was not aware of the powerful emotions music could elicit.

For all this, BioWare deserves a cookie. Heck, they deserve a whole batch of cookies for all of this. The ending, however,  merits no baked goods of any sort. My problem (and the problem of millions of other fans) is this: BioWare is a company that prides itself on making games where the player chooses what happens. Anyone who has played any of Bioware's other games, like the Dragon Age series, know that the endings to those games could have played out in many different ways. In Mass Effect 3, there were only three. All three ended with the Mass Relays, the source of intergalactic transport and the reason for the advanced state of organic civilization, being destroyed and all three end in Commander Shepard dying/on the verge of death and separated from his/her crew forever because the Mass Relays were destroyed.

Now, my problem is not that Shepard dies and nobody gets a happily ever after. Actually, I think that this is very realistic and is a good ending. No, my problem is that all three endings were <strong><em>very, very, very </em></strong>similar. I, along with God knows how many other people, are livid because Bioware took away from us the very reason we play Mass Effect:<em><strong> the ability to make choices. </strong></em>I know of many people who literally burst into tears because of the ending, and I know many others who were so angry that they broke their Xboxes. Personally, I felt really nauseated and saddened upon finishing my first play. However, online forums have given me a reason to have hope for the future. Rumor has it that a DLC will be released sometime in the future, and BioWare has confirmed that it is taking into account all player feedback.

So, what can fans expect? Honestly, I have no clue. The idea of adding on endings in not an entirely new idea; it was done with Fallout 3 a few years ago. However, this raises questions: Should an artist, in this case Bioware, change their artwork because people don't like it? Can the damage done to the series even be repaired? And if BioWare does make a DLC with more endings, how many endings will there be and when can we expect it? Only time will tell if BioWare will, or even can, repair the damage it has caused to its fan base.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Award winning actor, George Clooney, was recently arrested in Sudan along with his father for protesting. Both Clooney and his father had traveled to Sudan to protest the government for the recent killing of civilians in Sudan and to raise awareness. Clooney was given three separate warnings from the police, however all were ignored and he was soon arrested and escorted away by the US secret service.

The actor claims that the situation in Sudan is a “humanitarian disaster” and needs to be addressed as soon as possible. In his recent interview he stated, “It is a campaign of murder, and fear, and displacement and starvation. Religion is not an issue...in the camps you will see Christians and Muslims hiding together. It is ethnic in nature”.  Clooney, along with the protestors, accused Sudan’s president, Omar al-Bashir, of causing the recent killings of innocent civilians, which has blocked food from entering Nuba.  The cause of the disaster was the miscommunication between China and Sudan. China, who invested billions of dollars in oil infrastructures, has not been making a profit from Sudan. This cross border issue has caused China to take action, as shown in a recent video of a Chinese missile flying over Sudan.

In order to solve the problem, Clooney claims that America can help by using their best “weapon”. Diplomacy.  He believes that by working alongside China, America can create a mutually beneficial relationship that will help solve the issue of the oil infrastructures<strong>, </strong>while benefitting economically. However, there is no guarantee that American interference can fix this issue. Though there is no telling the future, George Clooney believes that there is still hope. As recently stated “The protection of civilians becomes the responsibility of the international community when their government fails to do so.”]]></content:encoded>

Spring time is here and so are your allergies! According to researchers, this spring will be the worst allergy season ever, but why is this so? A study published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the length of ragweed, a plant whose pollen causes allergies, season in various areas of the U.S. increased by as much as 27 days between 1995 and 2009. Are the different lengths of ragweed the culprit? Instead, researchers say climate change is the reason for such a powerful coming allergy season. Because of the unusually warm weather this winter, the allergy season has come early this year and “hit with a wheezing vengeance!”

According to Doctor Stanley Fineman, president-elect of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and an allergist at the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic, "The seasons are getting longer—they're starting earlier and pollens are getting released earlier." Not only is weather the problem, but CO2, or carbon dioxide percentage is high in the air. It feeds plants and leads to a greater release of pollen, and sometimes that pollen is more potent and more allergenic than it was when there was less CO2 in the atmosphere.
So, the real question is…how can we avoid experiencing all the sneezing, runny noses, congestion, itching, etc.?

Here are some suggestions:
1. Know what triggers your allergies. You may not be experiencing symptoms from pollen and the air around you, but some factors could be mold or fungus, which are exacerbated by April showers
2. Keep your windows shut and try to stay inside on dry days. Once you have located the trigger to your symptoms it is best that you avoid them in any way possible
3. Get rid of all kitchen chemicals. Household cleaning items can aggravate or even cause both indoor and outdoor allergies.
a. Avoid Triclosan, the active ingredient in antibacterial soaps, which has been found to be the cause of many indoor allergies.
4. Watch what you eat. Your body’s immune system can identify a similarity between the proteins of pollen and the proteins of fruit. When your allergies are at their worst, it is best to eat leafy greens.

“Climate chaos is hammering for your health!” So try your best to do right for your body so that this allergy season can be a little less sneezy!"

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you are tired of lugging around a 15 pound backpack to school every day? Join the club of millions of kids and parents who feel the same way. A controversial study over the last decade examined the negative effects of carrying heavy backpacks every single day to school.  Not only does lugging a backpack drain one’s physical energy, but it can also cause stress fractures in one’s back, inflammation of growth cartilage, nerve damage in the neck and shoulders, as well as neck strain.  The backpacks are damaging young children’s growing muscles and bones and leading to permanent orthopedic injuries.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ink.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1484" title="ink" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ink-300x248.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="248" /></a>

In 1999, a study in Italy revealed that 34% of school children carry 30% of their body weight once a week.  This is more than the proposed healthy amount of weight adults should carry.  Compare this to a 39 pound backpack being worn by a 176 pound man every day!  More recently, the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission said that a student lifting a 12 pound backpack 10 times a day for one year of school is basically carrying a weight of 216,000 pounds.

The too- heavy backpacks pull students backwards causing them to lean forward to stay centered.  This causes the discs on the vertebrae to squeeze together and the spine gets crushed.  Worst case, kids develop scoliosis (a curve in the spine) or contractures (lower back pains).  Best case, kids develop bad posture and rounded shoulders.  Neck pains occur when kids bending down have to look up in front of them. By walking around hunched over for long periods of time, students' balance can be compromised.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0434.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1485" title="IMG_0434" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0434.jpg" alt="" width="473" height="355" /></a></p>
Some suggestions for reducing the heavy load are deciding what needs to be taken home at the end of the day.  Although it may take some time to sort out what one needs, it’s worth it in the long run if it improves one’s health.  Only carry the binders that are needed to each class.  A good idea may be to switch books in between classes, so that when walking in the hallways, only the necessary binders are being carried.  Some schools may be financially able to get two sets of textbooks, one for the classroom and one for home.  Find a backpack with two, wide, padded straps that is no bigger than what is needed.  Never carry the backpack on one shoulder because it could lead to scoliosis and an imbalance in the way one walks.

Although we are living in an extremely technological time, there has been no decrease in the amount of paperwork children carry around all day.  President Obama started an initiative of switching all textbooks over to e-textbooks by 2017.  He is encouraging publishers and tablet makers to lesson the cost of electronics so that school children can be supplied with iPads and kindles.  There are many advantages to switching to e-textbooks.  They can be easily updated which will eliminate the cost for schools to update textbooks every five years to stay relevant with information.  Students will be able to communicate with teachers quickly, research more efficiently, check schoolwork often, and watch videos and diagrams that will facilitate learning.  Apple has already created applications for textbooks using iBook.  If technology and electronics can update to provide textbooks and workbooks, the amount of paper and schoolwork students have to carry every day will dramatically decrease and help to rebuild a taller and stronger young generation.

		<title>Vitamin D Keeps Your Summer Easy </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fun, fun, fun! Summertime is filled with sun, sun, sun! The summer months are quickly approaching, school is coming to an end, and beaches are opening, but just how much time should we really spend in this sun, sun, sun?! This summer, how can we make sure we receive enough vitamin D without risking skin damage?

Vitamin D is a necessary vitamin needed to add calcium and phosphorus to our diets. Our bodies create Vitamin D from direct sunlight on our skin. These minerals are important for healthy bones. A lack of vitamin D , or a <strong>deficiency</strong>,  can cause <strong>softening and weakening of bones and lead</strong> to bone deformities, so it is important that we spend some time in the sun, but too much time can be quite harmful and lead to a series of skin diseases and even some cancers.

The amount of time that you should spend in the sun is based on your skin tone, the time of the year, the time of the day, and how easily your skin burns. <strong>There is no single recommendation for everyone</strong>. Evidence suggests that the most effective time of day for vitamin D production is between 11am and 3pm. The longer you stay in the sun, especially for prolonged periods without sun protection, the greater the risk of <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Malignant-melanoma/Pages/Introduction.aspx">skin cancer</a>.

<strong>How should we protect our skin this summer, but still get efficient amounts of vitamin D?</strong>

<strong> </strong>Sun damage happens when the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays penetrate into the skin and damage cells. You can’t feel this happening, and it can occur even when the sun doesn’t feel very hot<strong>! The best way to avoid sun burn is to use sunscreen. </strong>Choose a sunscreen labeled "broad spectrum", which means it protects against both UVA and UVB rays, as well as a sunscreen receiving a rating of four to five stars. We also get vitamin D from some foods, such as oily fish (for example salmon, mackerel and sardines), eggs and meat. Vitamin D is also added to all margarine and infant formula milk, and to some breakfast cereals, soy products, dairy products, powdered milks and low-fat spreads.

With these tips, a safe yet enjoyable summer will be guaranteed. Just remember to pack the sunscreen!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In October 2011, we lost one of the most influential and inspiring men in America, Steve Jobs. Through Apple, Jobs was widely recognized as a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer revolution and was well known for his influential career in the computer and consumer electronics fields. Jobs also co-founded and served as chief executive of Pixar Animation Studios. He became a member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, when Disney acquired Pixar.

Over the course of a couple years, Apple has become the most valuable company in America. It has surpassed other electronic companies such as Dell and Sony in every aspect. Apple stocks have been higher than ever, at about $581.50 today and over the course of this year have doubled.

Apple is currently under the head of Tim Cook, who became the Chief Executive of Apple when Steve Jobs passed away. As the new chief executive, Cook has an optimistic view of the success of Apple in the upcoming years, saying that "Apple's momentum is incredibly strong, and we have some amazing new products in the pipeline." There is no doubt that Apple will continue to exceed other electronic companies and continue to come out with new and creative electronics that consumers all over the world will buy.

It is predicted that Apple stocks will continue to grow and set new records. The company will continue to work its way even higher and amaze people around the world. The latest rumor going around is the start of an Apple TV, so stay tuned for more information to come about that!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This February the Friends Academy Arts trip, chaperoned by Tracy Foster and Lisa Waldstein, traveled to Europe. David Hanna, Sabrina Ramkhelawan, Lucy Petropoulos, Lauren Egodigwe, Sierra Fisher, Cameron Hellerman, and I went on a week long tour of three European cities. We went from Milan, to Venice all the way to London. Over the course of a few short days we explored, forged new friendships, got lost countless times, immersed ourselves in diverse cultures, and most importantly, ate delicious food.

We flew out of JFK on the Friday that winter break started and headed for Milan. After a layover in Holland, where we passed the time with a photo scavenger hunt, and another excruciatingly long flight, we finally made it to Milan. The first thing we noticed when we stepped onto the Milanese streets was the omnipresent fashion that seemed present in every inch of the city. Everyone was impeccably dressed in the latest urban trends; whether it was a teenager rocking a pair of sick Nikes not yet released in the United States or an elderly woman casually strolling down the side walk in an elegant floor-length fur-coat: we had left the FA bubble of Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, and Vineyard Vines and stepped into a real-life fashion show in which every street was a runway. During our two days in Milan we saw Davinci’s <em>Last Supper</em>, climbed to the top of the magnificent<strong> </strong>Duomo, pounded the streets looking for gelato, and spent an eerie, but truly unique afternoon looking at the sculptures in the immense cemetery in the outlying region of the city.

[slideshow id=17]

After two days in Milan we hopped on a train and made our way to Venice. As we made our way off the rainy platform we were struck with a sight redolent to a Harry Potter film. Carnival was in full swing: the Venetians were adorned in masks and capes, there were concerts in the streets, and St. Peter’s square was buzzing with all kinds of costumes and food vendors selling everything from hot wine to crepes. The cities seemed like something out of a picturesque novel set in the 1600s and the fact that we were staying in a castle previously owned by the Venetian nobility only added to the allure. But with quaint, winding sidestreets and beautiful arcing bridges to explore, it’s no surprise that we didn’t spend much time in the hotel. We took advantage of every opportunity the chaperones gave us to explore the piazzas, cannals, and storefronts of the ancient city. On the last day, which happened to be the final and most celebrated day of Carnival, we made masks at a real workshop and wore them around when we went out to the festivities that night. After one of many amazing Italian dinners topped off with gelato and crepes we went on a spectacular gondala ride through the illuminated canals.

When our time in Venice came to a close, we kissed Italy good-bye and jetted over to Heathrow International Airport in London. During the day, we went sightseeing with our chaperones, visiting the London Eye, Camdon Market, and museums. We had even more freedom in London to go off on our own because speaking the native language made us a lot more comfortable; that meant that we had hours to explore hipster-havens. Places like Camdon Market, which were chalk-full of artwork, clothing stores, and souvenir stalls. At night, we went out to dinner and shows like <em>Matilada</em>. Over all, the shopping, sightseeing, eating, and play watching made for a really spectacular three days to wrap up our trip.

Landing in JFK after the long plane ride back was bittersweet because although it meant returning to our families, comfy beds, and homecooked meals, at the same time it meant saying good-bye to the friends and teachers who’d become our makeshift family. And even though the trip has long since ended, from time to time we stop in the hallways of FA or flip through albums on facebook to reminisce about the week we spent in “Euroswaggin’”.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s no secret that Americans love sports. Fans will travel hundreds of miles to see games, players will sacrifice everything for victory, and team merchandise is an incredibly lucrative business.

Sports comprise a significant portion of the college application process, and it is not rare for a student to choose a particular school solely for its athletic offerings. Each year, thousands of high school juniors and seniors are recruited, given scholarship money, or verbally committed to colleges across the country  based on their athletic skill. This is no small achievement: these kids have expended countless amounts of time and effort to hone their talents and become masters at whatever sport they play.

But has our obsession with college sports gone too far? These days, people can be accepted into very competitive schools without much consideration of their academic transcripts. In some schools, sports are god: the coaches get the first picks, and grades are overlooked.

Do sports carry as much weight in college applications in other countries? The answer is no. The United States is pretty much alone in its quest for the best college athletes, at least according to Andrew Disbury, an international  representative of Leeds Metropolitan University in England. “Extracurricular activities do not play any part in the assessment of applications for admission to UK universities, other than supporting the picture of the applicant as a fully rounded individual,” he told me in a recent email on the subject. “ It would be highly unlikely that an applicant  be accepted  with poor academics but a strong club sports or varsity sports background."  Andrew Disbury continued, "As a Director of Admissions, I have personally confirmed rejection decisions on applicants whose sporting background was strong but academic background not strong enough.”

When you go onto the website for the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, it takes a good amount of searching to find the link to the sports page, and even then, there isn’t much—only a couple of intramural sports and a fitness center. Meanwhile, American institutions usually have an athletics webpage that is front and center, complete with information about coaches, players and recent competitions, most schools in the rest of the world have very little. Unless you are going to a school that offers sports as a specific academic discipline, which some international colleges do, it seems that the focus of higher learning abroad is, well, learning. Now this is not a complaint: being a dedicated equestrian myself, I am well aware of the fact that my abilities may help me get into the college of my choice. I also know that many students who are less academically inclined are given a well-deserved chance to go to top schools through the doors opened by their involvement in sports. Maybe, though, it is time to reevaluate this part of our application process, to ensure that those who are very involved in athletics don’t miss out on the important academic tools they will need for the future.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hacking memorization with Spaced Repetition</title>

<blockquote>This post is part of the <a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/category/studyhacks/"><em>Study Hacks</em></a> series, written by Reed Rosenbluth.</blockquote>
If you’re like me, you despise memorizing things. After all, it was Einstein who said “Never memorize something that you can look up.” Yet unfortunately, us students are often put in situations where memorization can make our lives significantly easier. While I don't believe that memorization should ever be used as a students first weapon of choice, learning how to take advantage of a technique called Spaced Repetition can certainly come in handy.

The method of studying you are about to learn exploits something called the spacing effect, initially observed in 1885 by a German psychologist, to achieve results much better than conventional studying techniques. The spacing effect essentially says that if you can only study the answer to a question, say, 5 times, then your memory of the answer will be strongest if you spread your 5 tries out over a long period of time. The worst thing you can do is blow your 5 tries within a day or two.

So why do students bother cramming the night before the test, when they can practice Spaced Repetition. Because cramming <em>does</em> work. It’s true, through cramming, you can memorize quite well, but only for a short amount of time. When cramming, you trade a strong memory now for a weak memory later, and since tests are usually based on new material with the occasional old question cramming has become very popular amongst students.

But cramming is short sighted, and ignorant of the advantages of Spaced Repetition. “Knowledge builds on knowledge; one is not learning independent bits of trivia” says Gwern Branwen in his in depth <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20Repetition">article</a> about Spaced Repetition. According to memory research forgetting happens exponentially, following a predictable curve that varies from item to item. An item that you remember well has a flatter forgetting curve than an item you remember weakly. For example, you recall a fact without any effort, and give yourself a grade “A”. Next you recall a second fact, but only after putting in some effort, so you give yourself a grade “C”. The forgetting curve would predict that you would completely forget the grade “C” fact days before you would completely forget the grade “A” fact. Spaced Repetition techniques schedule an item for review right before the forgetting curve predicts you would have less-than-perfect recall. Not only does this minimize the number of items you need to review, but it also minimizes the number of reviews for each item.

Looking back, it is easy to see why cramming is so popular and Spaced Repetition isn’t. The payoff of Spaced Repetition is distant and unobvious and it requires a good deal of self control. In addition to this, the technique is slightly more complicated than simply cramming. But once you get the hang of it, you will never want to go back. So lets jump right in.
<h2>The Technique</h2>
The optimal way to practice Spaced Repetition would be to review a flashcard until you know it and then review it again right before you are about to forget it. But that’s the problem. If you’re just about to forget about it, how are you supposed to remember to review it. This paradox is resolved by using software to remember what we need to review and when we need to review it.
<h2>The Software</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>: flashcard software supporting images, audio, videos, scientific markup (via LaTeX). It also exists for almost every platform imagineable.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/">Mnemosyne Project</a>: another free flashcard tool that uses Spaced Repetition.</li>
</ul>
Overall, I’d have to say that Anki wins the software battle. It’s algorithm for optimized card ordering is better and it even makes great looking graphs and pie-charts showing you your study patterns.

In conclusion, Spaced Repetition software is pretty awesome. It is based on a famous effect discovered by science, and does a very good job at exploiting it. As Gwern Branwen says “It’s a testament to the Enlightenment ideal of improving humanity through reason and overcoming our human flaws; the idea of Spaced Repetition is seductive in its mathematical rigor.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Leviathan: An unnecessary DLC?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Leviathan-Announce-4.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1601" title="Leviathan-Announce-4" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Leviathan-Announce-4-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" width="710" height="399" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">BioWare deserves a lot of credit. Creating a successful video game is difficult; developers need to consider controls, graphics, plot and sound. Creating a successful sequel is even more difficult; developers now have to work within the confines of the established universe, create realistic character development, and live up to fan expectations created from the first game. Downloadable content (DLC), however, stands in a league of its own. Releasing a DLC is a precarious venture; most DLCs cost extra money, so developers need to take care to not look like they are just trying to milk the pockets of gamers. This means that total hours of gameplay, date of release, importance to the main plot, and quality of content are factors both taken into consideration by developers trying to please fans, and analyzed by fans with high standards. The Leviathan DLC, despite its flaws, does a fine job of meeting these standards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Leviathan DLC was released in August as an add-on for Mass Effect 3, the final game in a trilogy about the galactic war against the Reapers, a sentient race of machines bent on harvesting all organic life. The Leviathan DLC was created with intent of expanding upon the lore of the Mass Effect series and offering more insight into the origin of the Reapers. Without delving too deep into spoilers and details, the DLC did manage to accomplish this. The origin of the Reapers was explained thoroughly, and the plot of the DLC meshed well with the main storyline of the game. It was not, however, vital to the main plot. This is especially true because most players had already finished Mass Effect 3 prior to playing the DLC, making Leviathan an unnecessary add-on to the game. While it was very well-crafted, introduced interesting new characters with excellent voice-acting, had realistic sound and graphics, and provided exciting combat, it was fundamentally a glorified side quest. Apart from adding some lines to the final dialogue, it makes no difference to the ending of the series. This is important to many gamers, who are not willing to fork over $10 and spend hours on a mission that yields practically no results, no matter how good the quality is.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The fact that it was superfluous does not, however, diminish the quality of the DLC in any way. BioWare crafted an excellent mission that expanded immensely upon the the lore of the Mass Effect series, and for gamers new to the series who have not finished Mass Effect 3, or for players simply looking for more missions, Leviathan does not disappoint. However, gamers looking for a mission with a significant impact on the ending would do well to spend their $10 elsewhere.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The NYC Kindergarten Admission Process: A Follow-Up</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year, I wrote a deeply astonished yet brutally factual article about New York City’s cutthroat Kindergarten admission process. Since then, however, I had not come into direct contact with anyone immersed in the applications and interviews—until now. Seniors, a lot of this may sound very familiar.

My little cousin Siena is just one and a half years old, so she is applying to Nursery School. Yes, applying to Nursery School. And the process is just about as severe as the Kindergarten process, except the kids are younger and have less distinct personal qualities that might help them to be admitted to the city’s most selective schools. My uncle Gil is currently cranking out Nursery School application essays, faster—I am repulsed to say—than me with my college application essays. Typical essay questions center on the structure of the child’s day, the type of education the parents are looking for, and the activities and attributes that make each toddler “unique.” “There are specific buzzwords you have to hit,” says Gil. “’Creativity,’ ‘uniqueness,’ ‘passion,’ ‘love of learning,’ these are all things the schools want to hear.”

As Gil finds more and more ways to describe his daughter, my Aunt Sari busily shuttles Siena to and from gymnastics, music class, art class and others. “They definitely look for well-rounded kids,” she confirms. Gil and Sari have a key advantage, though: it just so happens that a very close friend of Sari’s is Dana Haddad, possibly the best private school educational consultant in the city. She helps hundreds of families a year and operates similarly to a college counselor, except for the fact that she sometimes works with children as young as 10 months of age. Her usual going rate is $500 an hour, $15,000 to see a family through the entire process; thankfully, she doesn’t charge my aunt and uncle.

Despite the pressure and expectations, Siena is a typical toddler, and wonderfully oblivious to the fact that she is applying to nine schools (more than I am applying to for college). There are only small signs of sessions with Dana: when asked a question, Siena replies with a sharp “yes,” and knows a few words in other languages. Like most kids when they first learn to walk, she struts around on her tippy-toes; a habit that should be broken with heavier boots that Dana advised Sari to buy. Apparently, it will look better in the interviews if Siena walks more properly. I’m sure that Siena will get into at least one of her first choices—just like college, it’s all about who you know, and Gil and Sari have some good connections. For now, however, as I type away furiously at college applications, Siena watches intently as her hero Elmo embarks on new adventures.]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Student Proposed Assemblies</h3>
The assembly calendar for the year is slowly filling up. Please see attached. If a club has a strong interest in a presentation, you and the club advisor must either meet with Mrs Schoman or e-mail her the GOAL of the assembly, the PLANS of how you intend to present, and any other support information. The goal is to keep Assemblies ONLY on Wed. A week and to be protective of the Wed B week Bonus Blocks. This means that we will not be able to accept all requests for assemblies. Priority will be given to those who have submitted a plan (as outlined above) and has been deemed to be a worthy proposal. The most successful assemblies are “student” led. If a speaker is to be considered, it is expected that a club member has personally seen the speaker present and comes highly recommended.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On October 24, the Upper School will have its first student political debate in two years. As the United State’s two major political parties prepare for the upcoming November election, Friends Academy’s Democrat and Republican clubs felt it appropriate to schedule a debate to inform students of today’s issues and the stances of the two parties. With the help of Mr. Lape, the two sides were able to agree on the terms of the debate in a move of bipartisan cooperation. The debate will include the two sides battling on the key fiscal issues of health care reform, the state of the economy, and foreign policy in relation to recent international current events. The only social issue currently on the agenda is the state of the American family and its relation to both workfare and welfare.

Republican leader Joseph Macy was able to exclusively tell Inkwell his side's current roster, which consists solely of seniors. In addition to Paul Asadorian, Tommy Kaminsky, Jack Bauer, and Macy himself, Joey hinted at a “secret weapon” that would also be participating in the event. Democrat leader Jake Silverman went a step further than Joey, telling Inkwell exactly what topics each team member of his side would be tackling. The diverse Democrat team includes sophomore Elijah Rechler, who will be doing the economy, the budget, and taxation; junior Nate Hogg, who will be on Social issues; and seniors Jake Silverman, who will be doing foreign policy, and William Duke, who will argue health care. Both sides will be receiving help from behind the scenes writers and researchers. Republicans initially nominated Senior Libertarian Jahan Kahn to be the nonpartisan moderator for the debate, but, in an unprecedented and controversial move, the Democrats vetoed his appointment. Since then, Jake Hawkins has been nominated to be the moderator, and Jahan Kahn will now be acting as time keeper.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/7694485612_ac013a7390_b.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1901 aligncenter" title="7694485612_ac013a7390_b" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/7694485612_ac013a7390_b.jpg" alt="" width="830" height="551" /></a></p>
Democrat leader Jake Silverman said of the debate, “it will be awesome.” Republican Tommy Kaminsky expressed similar excitement. When pressed on which topics the parties felt most confident about, both turned to health care, with Joey Macy stating that the Republicans “will be working with a practicing doctor” for accurate effects of new health care legislature, and Jake Silverman claiming that the Democrats “have insider sources into the health care industry.” Upon being told of Joey’s comments, Silverman was willing to guarantee that the Democrats would not be beaten in this part of the debate, stating on the record that they will not settle for less than a tie. As tension between the two sides rises, it is obvious how much work and time the two sides are putting into their preparation, as well as how interesting and informative it will be for the rest of the High School.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2261675599_1151d27f8a_o.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1902 aligncenter" title="2261675599_1151d27f8a_o" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2261675599_1151d27f8a_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="535" /></a></p>
As the Republicans and Democrats get ready for the debate, we recommend that students attempt to keep up with domestic and international current events by watching or reading the news. If you are interested in participating in the debate as a Republican or Democrat, you should contact the faculty leaders or students of a respective party’s club or Mr. Lape.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Correction as of 10/11/12: Tommy Kaminsky was originally misquoted as having predicted the upcoming debate to be a "dandy time". The reference has been removed.

It was taken by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ginnerobot/3341324364/in/photostream/">flickr user ginnerobot</a> and is being used under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">creative commons license</a>.</em>

Chin up, hand on your hip, fix your jacket and/or hair…1, 2, 3, snap! On September 24, the upper school students and faculty experienced déjà vu; picture day, round two. While rumors began circulating around the Friends Academy community pertaining as to why student photos had to be retaken, the full story has officially been confirmed. After careful consideration by Mr. Morris and Andrea Miller, the administration decided to discontinue business with the original photography company.

The original photographers made inappropriate and racial comments that made both students and staff uncomfortable. In an e-mail to parents of the student body, Mr. Morris commented, “I will not compromise our community standards and expectations at any time.” Students that felt uncomfortable spoke up and informed the office of the remarks that had been made by the photographers.  Sophomore, Javana Clark, shared that the photographer had called out, “Black girl, move over there.” This racial commentary, in addition to other student and staff complaints, resulted in the administration's decision to part ways with the company in question.

The photography company that captured the Lower School was brought in to redo picture day in the Middle and Upper divisions. Upper School principal, Ms. Schoman, is very pleased with the new company, remarking that they, “appreciate and are true to the mission of FA, recognizing kindness and respect at all times.”

<em>Check out how beautiful all your fellow classmates are as they said "cheese" for the excellent photographers.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday October 1st the Boys Junior Varsity football team went up against Great Neck South's team on Quaker turf. The team, consisting of many freshman boys and a few sophomores, played a long and hard game but unfortunately were defeated by the Rebels. Yet prospects are still bright for this group of talented young boys. Dwayne Taylor '13, a member of the Varsity football team and also an Inkwell staff photographer, went to the game and remarked on how relentless the boys were. (<em>Check out his photos below!)</em>

In other news, this is the Varsity team's <a href=" http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2012/03/21/friends-football-receives-some-big-offseason-news/">first year in the developmental league</a> and so far they have had an incredible season. Their record is 2 and 2 - significantly better than that of many recent years. Make sure to visit <a href="http://schedules.schedulestar.com/Friends-Academy-Locust-Valley-NY/">their schedule</a> to find out when they are playing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Friends Academy Girls Varsity Field Hockey team continued its two game win streak with a win in overtime over New Hyde Park this past Friday, October 5th. Despite a slight scare at the end of the first half, Friends's defense was solid the whole game and kept the game tied at 0-0. Alix Heffron broke the deadlock 1:30 into overtime off a pass from Alexa Landow to give Friends the 1-0 victory over New Hyde Park. This was the Quaker's second overtime win of the week; the previous game, the team scored a goal (Chloe Friedman; assisted by Alexa Landow) 30 seconds into overtime to defeat the Carle Place Frogs by a score of 1-0.

<em>Below are some action shots from the game on Friday.</em>

On October 9th, FAFH competed against East Meadow on home turf to bring home another victory 3-0. Most recently on October 10th, the Quakers extended their winning streak to five in a row with a victory over Oyster Bay by a score of 3-1! The team takes the field again at home this Friday, October 12th at 4:15 p.m against Sewanhaka.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the first chill in the air, students all around began to fully embrace the fall weather and start of school! FA kids are seen studious in art classes, club meetings, and in science class. It is evident we are all working hard! However, we did get the oh-so-fun visit of the animals at a petting zoo! Right outside our library was a real-life llama (rumored to be an alpaca), a goat, and a mini horse. Below are some great photos if you missed it :)

Enjoy some of these fun shots from our contributing peeps on the AWESOME inkwell photo team. A big thank you to Bridie Gahan '13, Amanda Yaraghi '16, Emily Dixon '16, Peter Bahr '16, Chloe Friedman '14 and Christina Yanello '16 who took these pictures .

Looking forward to beautiful autumn leaves this weekend at Fall Fair. If you are interested in photography bring your camera to capture the gorgeous gold, oranges, and deep reds of the changing season while enjoying the great food, music, sports, and fun of homecoming!

		<title>The Dos and Don&#039;ts of College Applications - with Mr. Dugger </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As college application deadlines approach, the College Office is flooded with Seniors pouring over essays and perfecting interviews. All elements of the application itself must be completed to the best of a student’s ability to give him or her a chance at acceptance, so it is definitely crunch time. One of the main questions students encounter as they embark on the long and arduous college process is what exactly should be put on the application—and what should be left out. I sat down with Mr. Dugger, the Director of College Counseling, during a rare lull in College Office activity to discuss his thoughts on this age-old issue: the dos and don’ts of college applications. Although freshmen and sophomores still have some time before they dive into the college process, it is never too early to start thinking.

[caption id="attachment_2331" align="aligncenter" width="764"]<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_2323.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2331" title="IMG_2323" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_2323.jpeg" alt="" width="764" height="804" /></a> Mr. Dugger[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left;">Beginning with the Don’ts: “Students should be truthful about all of the information put down, as this<em> is</em> a legal document,” cautions Dugger. “It is important not to include unnecessary details, and the Main Essay (on the common application) should not be a laundry list of what students have already done…A student should tell something, not everything.” In addition, “It is not a good idea to customize the application essay for each school, as this opens the door for grave errors,” he emphasizes. For example, “’…and this is why I really want to go to Clemson [University]’ accidentally written on the application for the University of Georgia,” something that would make a very unfavorable impression. Lastly, he states, “Students should not be <em>characters </em>of themselves, they must <em>be </em>themselves. A student should not try to be funny if she isn’t, or try to be overly creative if he is more of an analytical thinker.”</p>
The list of Dos is relatively straightforward if students adhere to common sense (which sometimes does get lost in the insanity of the college process). “Students should (of course) write their essays themselves, but can ask a teacher, family member or friend to proofread,” Dugger suggests. “Each question should be answered to the fullest and as completely as possible.” “Applications should be started <span style="text-decoration: underline;">early</span>, as in over the summer,” he stresses.  And finally, “If students apply Early Decision or Early Action, they should complete their regular decision applications before getting an answer from the early schools. This way, they will be completing the application from a place of strength, not defeat.”

In closing, Mr. Dugger left me with this nugget of wisdom: “The application should be an <strong>affirmation</strong> of who you are, not a <strong>representation</strong> of who you are.” Well said Mr. Dugger, well said.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The fall production at Friends Academy this year is <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em>. A hysterical play full of jokes and great music,<em> The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em> details the interactions of a few  stereotypical young spellers in their county spelling bee. This will be the first post in a series that will include first hand updates on how the rehearsals are going and other news about the show. Another one of Inkwell's very own, Nick McNiel, will be starring in it, as well as other Upper School students from all grades.

&nbsp;

This past Saturday was our second 8-hour Saturday rehearsal. (yes, actually 8 hours, from 10 AM to 6 PM) Spending the first 2 hours on choreography for a song centered around senior Kira Sanchez was intense but really fun and so worth it. We got to read and sing through the entire show, which was really exciting. The cast got to see the show as a whole and get even more excited than we already are.

If you want to check out the song we worked on, click here:<a title="I Speak Six Languages" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oQxXHZK3AY" target="_blank"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oQxXHZK3AY</a>. (Photo creds: Morgan Rielly)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Its been two more days of FA spirit week and they have been filled with fun, funky, crazy, and outrageous outfits at the academy of friends. The current standings are:
<ol>
	<li>Seniors- pulling a joke on the ENTIRE school by wearing their awesome senior t-shirts and jeans on clash day instead of clashing; a well earned lead! (t-shirts are 30$ gettem quick at Fall Fair Saturday) Today they washed the school in blue with fun ribbons and balloons to the surprise of the rest of the high-school when they arrived this morning. You even could've seen certain seniors dressed up as Cookie Monsters and handing out cookies during school. There was definite blue pride! 90pts</li>
	<li>Sophomores- holding their own against the seniors they really went all out on clash day looking horrid in their disgusting un-matching outfits. Today they looked sunny and bright in their yellow :) Lets see if they can hold out second place until tomorrow! 31pts</li>
	<li>Freshman- looking ridiculous in their eclectic clash day outfits the newbies to the Upper School are really doing a great job. Today they wore red and looked really vibrant! They are in a close second to the sophomores only by 9 points... Can they win enough points tomorrow to pass the sophomores for second place? 22pts</li>
	<li>Juniors- Boooo Juniors! Cannot really blame them on clash day, they had to take a 3+ hour PSAT exam and were definitely not the most festive (or awake!). However they really pulled it together today by going all out in GREEN. Can they bring enough spirit tomorrow to pull ahead and not finish last? We will have to wait and see! 18pts</li>
</ol>
Attention Upper Schoolers! Do not forget to buy your ticket for the homecoming dance. They will be sold tomorrow during lunch so if you want to attend the rocking rodeo tomorrow night after the bonfire you better get one! 10$, 15$ the night of.

<strong>Check out these awesome photos from days three and four!</strong>

<em>Thank you Amanda Yaraghi '16, Molly Sullivan '13, and Olivia Fine '16 for their excellent photography.</em>

<span style="color: #000080;">November 2<sup>nd</sup>  marks the end of the first “quarter” of our school year.  At this time, teachers will be entering a “calculated grade” for work done to date. Be sure you are “up to date” on all work to be completed and any assessments that might have been missed due to absence.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Keep in mind:</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Quarter grades are important for college Early Decision (in December).</li>
	<li>Calculated grades provide more consistency for teachers and clarity for students.  A mid-semester calculated grade offers “finality” and less “grey” area for everyone.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="color: #000080;">Additionally, the final semester 1 grade will continue to be a “cumulative” grade of work done from the beginning of school until January 11<sup>th</sup> when semester one ends.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Spirit Week Finale: Pep Rally and Fall Fair</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On October 19th, Spirit Week concluded with a whole school pep rally. Sporting Friends Academy red and black, the entire school gathered in the field house to celebrate the culmination of Spirit Week. This exciting event was full of cheering for fall sports teams and Friends Academy alumni and dancing led by pep rally leader John O'Brien. It was the perfect way to end the week.

Margot Mangiarotti ('13), who has attended Friends Academy since she was two years old and in playgroup. Her exceptionally long academic career at Friends Academy means that she has been to plenty of Fall Fairs. When asked about her experiences, she responded,
<blockquote>Having been at Friends Academy for 14 years, I have many memories stemming from the Fall Fair. This year was not very different from my nostalgic reflections, which were wonderful. The Fall Fair is and will forever be an event representing happiness and community. While my old favorite activity about the Fall Fair was hands-down the rides; now I enjoy seeing familiar faces: new friends and old friends! I remember refusing to return home after school to be the first on line for Pharaoh's Fury for family night. This year, I was most excited to see the alumni. The Fair represents our community as a whole, including parents and siblings of the students and faculty. This year was a definite success.</blockquote>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think the school, as a majority, favored the members on the republican side and may be bias in the poll. My overall opinion is that both sides were more or less equal for the first two topics, but the republicans had a stronger argument for the third and the democrats for the fourth.  I would have liked to see the responses to audience questions, but, from what was said, I think it's fair to say that the debate was a tie.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>FA Successfully Transitions From FirstClass to Gmail</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2012/10/29/fa-successfully-transitions-from-firstclass-to-gmail/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As of early October the FA email system went through a major transformation: Gmail is now the universal email system. Mr. Ken Ambach, the head of the tech department, was able to provide valuable information about the switch. According to Mr. Ambach, FirstClass was an “aging email platform” with many technical problems, such as space limitations and the lack of a calendaring tool. The lack of space caused emails to be automatically deleted after thirty-five days. The issue of space was a major problem for both teachers and students, so the search for a new email system began last year.

Gmail, or more specifically, Google Apps for Education, provided the answer. Mr. Ambach says that “Gmail is a modern email platform with solid spam and virus filtering built in. Google has provided each of our users with an almost ridiculous 25 gigabytes of email storage. The Calendaring and Contacts features of Gmail are very powerful and easy to use no matter what platform users use to access it. Most importantly, Google Apps for Education gives all of us access to a very powerful set of collaborative tools in Google Drive and Docs.”

After interviewing some students, the reaction to the transformation has been largely positive. Kara McNelis ('14) says, “Gmail is great for easy access. I like that you can share documents and I can easily see my email on my phone.” Some students would like a bit more assistance with the new switch. Emily Mara ('14), Julian Christian('15) and Jordan Christian('15) have all agreed that they don’t mind the switch, but they are not so sure how to navigate through the system. So far, there are good ratings of the new Gmail system within the FA community, but a little more assistance is is wanted by many students.

Mrs. James, Head of Library Services, echoed, “I was comfortable with First Class, but I am also happy with Gmail. Gmail is easy to access and I like the new calendar tools that it offers. However, Gmail does take a while to get used to.”

With the transition firmly in place and students and faculty alike beginning to adjust and embrace the new platform, Gmail and Google Apps for Education looks like a keeper.]]></content:encoded>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Halloween Dress Code Reminders:</span></h3>
<span style="color: #000080;">You may dress in a costume- but it needs to be a costume and not just an opportunity for a dress down day (i.e. t-shirt and jeans and no evidence of thought given to what you are! ) Costumes should exhibit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">modesty</span>! As a school that is committed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">peace and non-violence</span>, select your costume with this in consideration. Classes will select top costumes to compete in the annual Halloween Assembly Contest! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO CANDY is to be brought into the theater for the contest! </span>(There is also a teacher category! So yes, teachers may also dress up!) </span><span style="color: #000080;">If you choose to not engage in the costume event, you are expected to wear regular dress code attire.</span>

<span style="color: #000080;">November 2<sup>nd </sup>marks the end of the first “quarter” of our school year. At this time, teachers will be entering a “calculated grade” for work done to date. The grades at this time provide students an opportunity to reset goals and identify plans of action to ensure a strong end to first semester.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3>Keep in mind:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Quarter grades are important for college Early Decision (in December).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Calculated grades provide more consistency for teachers and clarity for students.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="color: #000080;">The final semester 1 grade will continue to be a “cumulative” grade of work done from the beginning of school until January 11<sup>th</sup> when semester one ends.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Aftermath of Sandy: In Photos</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After two harrowing weeks for many members of the FA community, I know that I am not the only one that is slightly happy to be back on campus and returning to a normal routine, aka life before Sandy. I inquired last week for students and faculty to send photos from their experiences with Sandy. The photos that started to flood into my inbox were shocking. So much devastation so close to home. Photos ranging from the churning waters of the ocean in Montauk, the wild waves destroying the pier in Long Beach, the chilling boats standing on top of front lawns in Freeport and Bellmore, and the trees down like dominos all over Locust Valley and Brookville, left me open mouthed as I looked. I invite you to look at these powerful and humbling photos (below) by your classmates and teachers of the Hurricane that shook up life on Long Island, the monstrous Sandy.

My immense gratitude to Parker Huseby '14, Maggie Brennan '14, Natasha Makowsky '14, Luke Sandoval '16, Eric Friedlander '15, Jamisen Beechler-Ernst '16, Mr. Burt, Mr. Alber, Taylor Quinland '14,  Alana Pascucci '14, and Kristina Kim '14 for contributing the incredible images.

The true power of Mother Nature was witnessed in these last two weeks. All I can say is I hope all of you are safe, warm, and have both electricity in your homes and gas in your car!

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information/ Reminders/ Announcements:</span></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>Internet Access</h3>
Please be sure to inform your teachers if you do not have access to internet from home.  I have asked your teachers to provide you with a printed syllabus if you cannot view the portals. Also, teachers will be writing the daily HW on the board to ensure those without internet have the information needed.

&nbsp;
<h3>Mid-Semester Grades</h3>
Please remember that your mid-semester grades are “unofficial” and do not become part of your permanent record. The purpose of the grades is to give you an understanding of your progress thus far in the first semester.

&nbsp;

If you received a grade that you are not pleased with, it is important to develop a plan of action to improve the grade. You should speak with your teacher and discuss what you can do to improve- i.e.  Submit a draft of written work prior to due date to receive teacher feedback? Extra help- especially prior to assessments? Suggested study skills?  Time management under control?

&nbsp;

Remember, YOU are driving your educational experience and it is important to take responsibility for your work. Your teachers are there to support you<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> but you need to demonstrate the commitment and motivation to reach your potential.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite the devastation Hurricane Sandy wrought across the Northeastern seaboard, FA is back in session and readier than ever to get its hands dirty in post-Sandy service.  While the two-week break was needed, the circumstances that brought on the hiatus are devastating and unfortunate. After 10 days without power, Friends got it’s electricity back Tuesday evening thanks to the tireless work of a crew hailing all the way from Tennessee.  While the FA community returned to relative normalcy, many thousands across the region continue to be in distress due to the impact of the super-storm.

After harrowing winds of 70 mph and a massive storm surge, Hurricane Sandy died out leaving a damaged Northeast. Hurricane Sandy left floods, destroyed homes, deaths, and power outages in its wake all along the coasts of New Jersey, Connecticut, New York City, and Long Island. Along the Jersey shore homes have floated away. In Nassau and Suffolk County, houses and boardwalks have been decimated with flooding up to seven feet high. In New York City the subways, residential and commercial buildings’ garages are filled to the ceiling with water.  In Greenwich, Connecticut four multimillion-dollar mansions on the water burned and were completely razed.  Towns hit the hardest include Long Beach, Port Jefferson, Breezy Point, South Side, Babylon Village, South Mantoloking (NJ), and Monmouth City (NJ).

Ms. Schoman, who lives in Babylon Village, stated, “Hundreds of families south of Montauk Highway are unable to live in their homes due to the high water surges that came in during Sandy. While there was definitely downed tree damage, the larger issue was the fact that homes were destroyed by the high wind and high waters.”

Homes have been lifted off of their foundations and drifted away.  Families have been left with nothing but the clothing on their backs. People can be found digging through the mess of broken homes and rubble, searching for photographs and any objects that represent the life that has been so brutally disrupted.  Dwayne Taylor, a senior living in Baldwin, remarked, “the amount of flooding and damage has scarred and devastated the many families affected throughout Long Island.”  Aggie Jones, FA’s Associate Director of Athletics, saw most vividly the terrible impact of Hurricane Sandy and a community bound together in response.

Ms. Jones divulged, “I had the right mind to save my family pictures with many memories and I am so grateful for that; they can never ever be replaced. I have seen many kind people doing kind things for each other and it warms my heart. Neighbors being neighbors, helping each other.”

Her home was left wrecked; yet, despite this she is keeping a positive attitude.  Optimism and unified communities proved to be some of the brighter human stories in the midst of the storm's darkest moments.

&nbsp;

Despite the horrifying consequences of the storm, organizations and volunteers are embracing the annihilated towns and stepping in to assist.  Families who have been devastated themselves are opening their hearts and homes to others who are in need.  Communities are unifying to begin picking up the pieces.  Just days before the election, President Obama interrupted his campaigning to focus on the victims of the hurricane and visited towns affected in New Jersey.  With President Obama’s instruction, FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) personnel have been deployed throughout towns and cities hit by the hurricane and are leading search and rescue missions, repairing communications apparati, providing door-to-door food drop offs for victims, and identifying damaged homes for repair.  Through FEMA, response operations are being executed efficiently and communities are beginning to be rebuilt.  Along with the federal government, many religious organizations are collecting food and clothing and distributing the essentials to traumatized victims.

The FA community has responded in extraordinary ways as well, honoring its Quaker roots by taking action through service.  In a conversation with Mr. Morris, he voiced, “The FA Community has been remarkable in rallying to help others.  Over the last two weeks, people have reached out to each other, and we are beginning our broader outreach.  Helping others is so woven into the fabric of FA, so I know that in the weeks and months ahead, we will be making a difference.”  Families within the community have made donations, sandwiches, traveled to hard-hit communities to physically lend a hand, as well as support.  Clubs such as Diversity and the WATCH committee as well as students are collecting coats, candy, food, sweatshirts, and essentials such as toiletries.

Morgan Rielly, a student who recently started raising money for gift cards for Sandy victims explained her mindset: “I was upset about losing power and wifi connection. But after looking at people who have lost everything, I am really humbled.”

Please contact Rachel Hall or Ron Baskind for more information about ways to get involved within or outside of the FA community.

<div>On Saturday November 10<sup>th</sup>, a number of families in our Friends Academy community showed up to the cafeteria to make hundreds of sandwiches. Participants made and contributed sandwiches in relief for the victims of the horrible Hurricane Sandy. Students in all grade levels and their parents showed their support by donating boxes of clothes and toiletries as well as participating in the sandwich making. These families not only made sandwiches but also bought sandwich supplies (meat, cheese, bread, condiments, baggies, and gloves). Then they packaged the sandwiches they made in little baggies and carried the heavy boxes filled with sandwiches to the buses and cars that would be delivering the sandwiches along with donated supplies down to Long Beach. It was a wonderful turn out, several teachers participated as well as students; the result of everyone's hard work was unbelievable. The Long Beach families were thrilled and so very appreciative of the work our FA community put into this sandwich-making and clothing and toiletry donations.</div>
<div>At Friends Academy, we are so fortunate to have such a service-oriented community. Our close-knit community has truly been able to come together over the past couple of weeks, as we usually do in any sort of crisis, and help each other and others in need.</div>
Thank you to all who came out and supported last Saturday, and we hope to see you, as well as many more families, continue to attend these "beneficial-to-all" community service events!

		<title>5 Reasons I loved Hurricane Sandy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>1. Waiting in Line for Gas</h2>
Due to a lack of electricity, many gas stations couldn’t use their electric pumps to distribute fuel to their gas-guzzling Long Island customers. This meant that when there was a station with gas and electricity, people flocked to it in hopes of finding the sweet, sweet nectar that is gasoline. When I had to go get gas for our generator, I was forced to wait in line for hours chatting up the nearest person I could find. “So, where do you live on Long Island? What a coincidence I live in the same state as you! We have so much in common!” And what’s more fun than standing in the cold and talking to that greasy guy who thinks your arm is a burrito? Nothing.
<h2>2. Finding My Way in the Dark</h2>
Without electricity, my house was dark - I mean just pitch black - and despite my cat-like night vision, it was difficult to navigate through the labyrinth that is my house at night. I often found myself wandering for hours on end just trying to find the bathroom only to realize that I had stumbled into a deep subterranean cave inhabited only by bats and hipsters. My nighttime walks lead to numerous discoveries such as how babies are really made, the cotton gin and Tony Shalhoub’s stunt double. Thanks to Sandy, I have gained a new appreciation for the dark, and Tony Shalhoub.
<h2>3. Not Having Hot Water</h2>
My hot water heater is powered by electricity. Once my power went out, so did my hot water. As much as I love a hot shower, after 3 shower-less days, I realized that showers are unnecessary. Simply a waste of time. I used to take showers every night, losing 15 precious minutes in the process. Minutes I could have been using to knit, landscape or even train german shepherds. Now, I only take a shower once a month. My days feel longer, my friends seem fewer and my loved ones have left me. All in all, a great success.
<h2>4. Live, Dangling Power Lines</h2>
As the winds of Sandy battered my house, I couldn’t help but to think about those poor, poor power-lines that were most likely experiencing the ride of their lives. Nonetheless, I snuggled into bed and tried to dream of a happier place full of sugar plums and dancing midgets. As soon as I woke up the next morning, I threw on my boots and my jacket and dove through my window to survey the neighborhood. As I walked, I saw numerous power lines dangling before me, sizzling with energy. Being a man of action, I reached out and grabbed each power-line to see if it was in fact, energetic. Most of the lines were. With each 765,000 volt shock, I felt more and more invigorated and alive. At the end of the day, I felt as though I could lift a car. I couldn’t, but that's neither here nor there.
<h2>5. Basement Flooding</h2>
In addition to winds exceeding 5,000 mph, hurricane sandy deposited over 50 billion gallons of fresh rain water on the tristate area. This meant flooding and a lot of it. Because my house is located on a high mountain cliff, I was not affected by rising waters; but I was able to travel to a neighbor’s flooded basement. I arrived in my finest rainbow speedo and dove into the mirky, trinket filled waters. Despite their cries to “stop that right now”, I snorkeled through the soaked basement for the good part of 2 days, finding forgotten treasures and discarded grandparents. We laughed hard, swam well and got lost in a world of our own. But like all flooded basements, it had to dry up and so I returned to my mountain bluff, to observe my kingdom and keep watch for the next storm on the horizon.

So that’s the list for this week, tune in next week for another list that’s sure to waste more of your time.

This post is the first piece in the series called <em>The 5</em>, written by Nick McNiel.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Brooklyn Free School: A Look Inside the Progressive Education Movement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine a school where classes don’t exist, grades aren’t calculated, and tests are an anathema. A place where students are never given homework, and arrive each day prepared to do whatever they want; where teachers don’t dictate or evaluate. This place is real: it’s the Brooklyn Free School, located in the Clinton Hill area of Brooklyn, New York. Founded in 2003 by its current director Alan Berger, the school is built fundamentally on the principle that each child has an innate curiosity and passion for learning. At its core, the school is based on free school predecessors such as the Summerhill School in England, the Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts, and the Albany Free School in Albany. In its essence, BFS gives students the opportunity to pursue their own interests with the support and guidance of mentors and peers.

No matter how extensively outsiders have researched the school, it is impossible to get a true feel of the place without witnessing this philosophy in action. The Brooklyn Free School’s mission is not to be confused with the well-known Montessori style of education--it is more radical and less structured, giving students full independence. Mr. Berger meets visitors at the door of the BFS building: a narrow townhouse that seems to modestly hide the gravity of the things that go on within its walls. He proceeds to explain the daily routine, showing the visiting group around each of the five stories as if he were taking a guest around a family home. The sound of laughter and pounding feet on the wooden staircases prevail, as the younger children go out to play in Fort Greene Park. Each student is immersed in activity: one girl is carefully furnishing a miniature cardboard townhouse with handmade clay appliances; another boy is busily building a Lego rocket ship with the help of a friend.  Soft guitar chords float down from the cozy social room, where teenagers relax and read magazines. First time observers quickly realize that they are not in Kansas anymore.

It is not uncommon for visitors from traditional environments to have dozens of pressing questions as they arrive at the Brooklyn Free School. How do students know what they like if they aren’t exposed to the traditional array of subjects? Do students go on to become successful adults? How does the school ensure that students learn the basics? How do students graduate, and do they move on to college? Endlessly faced with such inquiries, Mr. Berger answers each in stride, with the school and the students as a backdrop to support his theories with actions and results. Perhaps it is suitable to begin with the components that constitute a “Free School.”

A cornerstone of the BFS philosophy is the weekly Democratic Meeting, an unorthodox methodology where students and teachers work together to plan upcoming events, resolve conflict, and make curriculum-oriented decisions. All of the over sixty students, ages 4-18, have a vote and an opinion that is valued. Beyond that, a mandatory lunchtime, and some clean-up responsibilities that resemble Work Crew, a student’s typical day is entirely free of any sort of structured obligations. However, as Mr. Berger was quick to explain, this absolutely does not mean that students simply sit around all day. The BFS schedule, mutually agreed upon in the Democratic Meeting, is full of all kinds of activities and offerings, ranging from theater instruction to a Friday field trip (the one several weeks ago was to a Pizzeria, as the school’s theme this year is “all about Brooklyn” and students were going to learn about the Pizza-making process). Daily “intensives,” run slightly more like classes, include Subway Math, Casino Games, and a study of Personal Narratives. Student-led clubs are active as well: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Odyssey</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life of Pi</span> are two of the books currently being read by book groups, and the Dungeons and Dragons club is now operating in full swing. Unlike conventional schools, of course, all of the above are optional. Subjects taught at BFS don’t fall into particular categories; they just cover anything and everything that students demonstrate an interest in. Students aren’t separated by age, but are loosely grouped into advisory sections spanning several grade levels. And teachers, of which there are just a handful, don’t actually “teach” in the usual sense of the word—they instead act as mentors, opening the students’ eyes to ideas and helping them to learn what they love.

Since BFS has the time to delve into so many subjects, students are really exposed to much more than any student at a traditional school. They also are able to explore their interests in much greater depth, which often leads to additional crossover of topics and the desire to learn more about several subjects at once. The question of alumni success is more difficult to answer, as success has a variety of definitions and cannot be numerically quantified. In Paul Tough’s book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Children Succeed,</span> he emphasizes that character qualities such as perseverance, curiosity, conscientiousness, optimism and self-control are what help children to become successful later in life, not high scores on standardized tests. This is directly in line with the mission at BFS: students are encouraged to be creative, passionate and thoughtful, they are taught to be respected members of their communities, and they are propelled to take charge of their own education. A great value is placed on character, as exemplified by the Democratic Meeting.

Still, skeptical parents and educators are concerned about the learning of the basics. “It’s out of context learning,” says Mr. Berger, “So the basics are kind of covered to the extent that they need them.” But what are the ‘basics,’ anyway? Reading, writing and math, widely considered to be the foundation of all further education, are taught at BFS as students express a desire to learn them. However, since those three disciplines are so important to everything else, students generally come across them early on in pursuit of their interests. If students are taught when they are hungry to know, the thought process at BFS goes, they will acquire the new skills much faster and will come away with a deeper understanding of the material.

In a school with no requirements, questions about diplomas and college abound from visitors. In order to graduate from BFS, students must declare their intention to move on at least two years prior, so that they can spend ample time preparing a presentation and assembling a committee of mentors. The presentation covers what the student has learned at BFS, plans for the future and reasons for taking the desired next step. After hearing from the student, the committee votes, and three fourths of the votes are needed to graduate. Most students are approved by their committee, but those that are not awarded the votes are simply given time to reflect and revise their presentations. And most decide to go on to college, which means that they do have to take the standardized college admissions tests. Mr. Berger acknowledges: “We understand too that there are a lot of things [students] are going to have to just get through…They’ll take SATs, they’ll take RCT’s here, and there will be some prep for that… they just have to do certain things to get the diploma, get that out of the way so they can be free to learn what they want.” Do students actually get in to college? “Most students get in to the colleges of their choice, because schools want to diversify their campuses,” he explains. Certainly, a background as a Brooklyn Free School student would look very interesting to a college admissions office. According to Mr. Berger, students adjust well to the college curriculum, as they have already honed their interests and are practiced in the art of setting their own educational courses. It is unclear, however, just how well students handle deadlines and set schedules.

As BFS celebrates the differences in each child, its staff also acknowledges that its revolutionary curriculum doesn’t work for everyone. Some students thrive on structure, or are so used to it that their time at BFS is not as productive as it could be. The school specifically does not accept students over 15 years of age, as they would already be so used to traditional education that they would not be able to adjust. Even so, students who transfer from other schools usually take what Mr. Berger calls a “detox” period: they become overwhelmed by all the free time they suddenly have and spend a month or two just sitting in the social lounge or playing games. Before too long, however, he sees them become gripped by a desire to learn, and they feverishly take charge of their education.

The Brooklyn Free School may seem like a beacon of hope in an era of increasingly standardized, creativity-crushing educational darkness—or as “One Man’s Solution to the Educational Rat Race” as Tara Bahrampour described it in her New York Times article about the school. In essence, can Progressive education survive in this era? Furthermore, can this approach diffuse into other academic environments? Although Friends Academy tends to follow a more traditional route, Mr. Morris has done a lot of thinking about Progressive education. “As an approach to learning it makes infinite sense,” he says, noting the collaboration that goes on in environments such as the Brooklyn Free School and pointing to the fact that students are connected to real-world experiences. However, he also emphasizes that a Quaker school naturally has some Progressive elements: “With Quakers, everything still starts with queries, or inquires, like [at] Progressive schools.” While more school districts seem to be implementing numerically driven methods, Mr. Morris believes that “the pendulum is starting to move back in the other direction,” towards Progressivism. “We are trending in the direction of some of the more Progressive schools,” he says, explaining that “some teachers are frustrated” with the structure and demand of AP courses.

Some students are frustrated as well. In typical high school classroom that is not on an advanced track, it is common to see a good majority of students dragging their feet, completely bored, or entirely disinterested and disengaged. Participation can be minimal at best; nobody seems to care. Coming from this atmosphere, the Brooklyn Free School is a world away—a good majority of the students cannot contain their excited exclamations as they work on a new project or tackle a new challenge. It would be unfair for Friends Academy students to anticipate that this kind of radical, free-for-all learning will make an appearance in this area anytime soon. Although Mr. Morris continually works to adapt the school’s curriculum to modern demands and methods, “I think in this climate of the North Shore of Long Island it would be difficult [for a Progressive school] to be successful,” he concedes. The region is just too competitive and traditionally focused.

Although Mr. Berger does believe that his brainchild is a representation of schools of the future, he realistically concludes that such extreme conversions will take decades to be accepted by the public. The focus of society at this point remains grades, scores, GPAs and class rankings. Mr. Berger stresses the enormous effects of college decisions on all other levels of schooling: as long as colleges don’t change their criteria for accepting students, high schools won’t change either, preventing shifts for elementary schools and so on down to the earliest stages of childhood learning. For now, schools such as the Brooklyn Free School will remain isolated Petri dishes of Progressive experimentation, serving as points of contrast for traditional schools and as topics of debate for educational theorists. Small as they are, these schools certainly prove their importance. If nothing else, they exist to test the minds of conventional educators; always forcing them to ask themselves if the methods they have chosen to support are indeed the right ones.

		<title>Bring it On: Cheerleading at FA</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friends Academy, known for its outstanding school spirit, surprisingly will not have a cheerleading squad this year.  While the girls cheerleading squad usually cheers on the boys and girls basketball games, there has been no interest this winter season. Alan Quackenbush, the Athletic Director, explained, “Unfortunately there was little interest this year in having a cheerleading squad, despite the initiative that our new coach took in speaking with the students about becoming involved."

The situation is puzzling because there were juniors, sophomores, and even freshman on the team last year that were supposed to carry the team into the following year.  Grace Covelli, a tenth grader who choose not to continue cheerleading this year, stated, “The team [last year] was disorganized.  I came to all of the meetings and we didn’t really do anything.”  Members felt that the team was unproductive and lacked the necessary passion to make cheerleading exciting.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2637" title="5456642295_0b306cf8f5" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/5456642295_0b306cf8f5-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />

In reality, cheerleading has not such a popular sport at Friends Academy for a while now.  The storybook cliché of the “popular” cheerleader dating the “popular” football quarterback is an outdated notion. So, without a group of enthusiastic seniors advertising the benefits of cheerleading, the squad not only lost its previous members but also could not attract prospective members.

Members of the girls varsity basketball team did not really care about the lack of a cheerleading team this season.  Rosie Mangiarotti, who has been on the varsity squad since eighth grade, commented, “The girls cheerleaders rarely came to the girl’s games anyway, so it doesn’t even affect us.”

However, members of the boys basketball teams had a different perspective. Jack Forlines and Jonny Nierenberg, varsity basketball players, stated, “We are disappointed there are no cheerleaders. You’re going to be able to hear a needle drop in the gym.  We need to compensate for the absence of cheerleaders with more fans.”

To reassure the basketball team members that they have not been forgotten, Mr. Quackenbush stated, “The good news is that we will be offering a [cheerleading] program for our middle school girls during the winter one season, in an effort to generate interest and the hope that we will be able to resurrect this program next year.”  With the Danes arriving at Friends Academy this week, the students are sure to take more of an interest in basketball.  Not only the talent but also the height of the Danes basketball squad always amazes the Friends Academy community.  Hopefully with the arrival of the foreign team, spirit and support will be in full swing, even if pom-poms aren’t shaking.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>In the Works: Restructuring the English and History Departments</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An important project is taking shape on the third floor of Gideon Frost Hall. Spearheaded by Christine Kulke and Elizabeth Phillips, respective heads of the History and English Departments, the initiative calls for a more globally-focused and interdisciplinary curriculum. This means that future English and History classes will cover the same topics at the same times with a broader perspective. Collaborative teaching will be encouraged, as will projects that apply to both subjects at once. For example, if a History class is learning about the period of the 1920s in American society, an English class will read and discuss literary works of the same era. The goal is to create an environment where students can make connections between the material of both disciplines, ultimately giving them a better understanding of what they are learning.

Mrs. Kulke is very enthusiastic about the progress thus far, and describes her and Doc Phillips’ ideas as coming together very naturally. “At my old school (in California), there was just one ‘Humanities’ Department,” recalls Mrs. Kulke. English and History were taught as one combined subject, an interesting concept that may be hard to envision at a traditional school like Friends. However, both teachers are optimistic about the time frame of their proposal, and hope to complete step one by next fall: The introduction of a more global, more accessible History textbook for freshmen and sophomores. Realistically, a full shift of the curriculum in this direction will take several years to complete. While current juniors may be too late to benefit from some of the changes taking place, they may notice a few of the new developments as seniors. Assuming that all goes well, current underclassmen will be the first to experience the implementation of some very high-level educational concepts.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Shorter Winter Break: A No-Go?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Remember Hurricane Sandy? The storm that kept the majority of the Northeast region out of school for two weeks?  The reason that Friends Academy has school Thursday, December 20 and Friday, December 21?  Although this “problem” is relatively small compared to the repercussions felt by cities hit hard by the super storm, the opening of school this Thursday and Friday is causing controversy in the Friends Academy community.

Many students and parents are questioning why the added days are necessary, given that Friends Academy is a private school with no legal day requirement.  The major reason for the addition is that classes must make up the missed days of work in order to be prepared for end of the year exams.  Another reason is that families pay a lot of money for private school and deserve to get their money’s worth of the school year.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/winter.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2727" title="winter" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/winter-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a>

Mr. Morris addressed this quandary by stating, “After we lost 9 class days, we knew we had to gain back as many as we could during the school year, not in June when they are not productive for anyone.  When I decided to pull back the days from December and April breaks, we knew that some students would not be able to be here…I do appreciate the efforts families have made to adjust to the changes in the calendar."

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/calander1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2729" title="calander" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/calander1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>

The question of whether students will actually show up is a bigger worry for the administrators and teachers in the community. Mrs. Schoman had asked parents of students who will not be attending school these days to e-mail her.  She explained, “We recognize that some families were unable to change previously made travel arrangements and will consider absences due to this as 'excused.' Students are however responsible to let their teachers know ahead of time and if possible make up work before leaving.”  Teachers have been advised not to give tests on these days; however, students who miss class are required to complete their work in a timely fashion.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/airplane.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2728" title="airplane" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/airplane-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

Students and parents alike are upset with the addition of school days, especially because many have flights booked that are nonrefundable. Some who are missing school due to these scheduling issues complain that it adds undue stress when they have to make up the work. The turnout of students in attendance will be interesting to track, but hopefully the holiday dress down day on Friday, December 21 will encourage students to come to school and display their holiday spirit!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Insider&#039;s Interview: Upcoming Production of &quot;Neverwhere&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="line-height: 1.5;">This February the Friends Academy Theater Department will put on a production of Neil Gaiman’s </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">Neverwhere</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">.</span>

“It’s a very different show for [Friends Academy] to do, because it is an underground fantasy with different magical elements,” explained Director Andrew Geha, who describes<em> Neverwhere</em> as "a dark journey into this magical underworld of London.”

The author of the novel is “well-known in the industry for his genre of urban fantasy.” For example, Tim Burton’s <em>Coraline</em> and the movie <em>Stardust</em> are both based off Gaiman’s books. Geha decided to stay true to the exciting novel script-wise, but is adding “instrumental and choral Gregorian chant-like music, with no lyrics.” The winter show is always a large cast - this year it has forty-one cast members, not including crew and musicians.

And although Friends Academy production sets are always great (thank you Mr. Grant)<strong>,</strong> <em>Neverwhere</em>'s set should be particularly fantastic, for the action takes place literally from the top of the stage to the underground pit (see pictures).

Geha explained how this show has a different feel from ones the theater department has done before. “There’s some bloodiness and some really good humor… and a lot of good dark humor. It’s a whole lot of fun and has a good message to say in the end.”

Although the winter play will be vastly different from the light-hearted fall musical, it is sure to also be a great hit. Be sure to come see <em>Neverwhere</em> in early February for a unique and thrilling show. Keep checking Inkwell for more updates on the production!

		<title>The New Backpack Policy: Safety First, Convenience Later</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The amount of walking space available in the Dolan Center before Monday Assembly was remarkable.  Instead of a single file line that one would get pushed, shoved, and trampled in to get to the theatre doors, three to four students could walk side by side without any harm. The reason for this newfound body room is the new backpack policy in the Atrium and vestibules that began last Monday. The policy states that during morning meetings in the Dolan Center, freshmen are to bring their backpacks into the theatre, sophomores should place their backpacks on the shelves and the floor under the shelves outside of the choir room, and seniors should carry their backpacks into the Commons.  Before Meeting for Worship and Lunch, backpacks should be left either in the classroom the students are coming from or heading to.  Additionally, backpacks can be left in the lower social space and under the bridge.  Junior, Nick Chapman stated, "They [administration] outlined no [backpacks] in the Atrium and then forbid us from putting them anywhere besides classrooms."  To compensate for the limited space, the maintenance staff placed benches temporarily under the colonnade outside of the Dolan Center for backpacks.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2013-01-09-12.31.30.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2775" title="2013-01-09 12.31.30" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2013-01-09-12.31.30-1024x764.jpg" alt="&quot;No Bookbags Here&quot;" width="710" height="529" /></a>

To students in the Friends Academy community, this new backpack policy was enforced relatively quickly and randomly.  Senior, Reed Rosenbluth, stated, “I'm not quite sure where to put my backpack anymore when heading to lunch. I don't like to leave my backpack outside, as it contains my laptop and the cold kills the battery.”  After speaking to Mrs. Schoman, it is apparent that the administration put much time and thought into this policy.  The main issue is the safety of every member in the community. There have been many near accidents where people have tripped over backpacks and nearly fallen down the stairs.  Javana Clark, a sophomore, said, "The policy is annoying, but it makes sense."  In case of a fire drill, the Atrium needs to be clear so that people can enter the theatre quickly without hazard.  Friends Academy has a beautiful exterior campus, the inside should be just the same.  The only challenge with keeping the inside of the Dolan Center backpack free is that the backpacks are now cluttered outside, which detracts from the beauty of the campus.

Mrs. Schoman explained, “We all have a responsibility to make sure that we care for our "home"- FA is our home! And having these backpacks littered around the atrium is really just unsightly! This is not so different from your parents asking you "clean up after yourself" at home!”

The consequence for leaving a backpack in the Dolan Center Atrium is simple: unattended backpacks will be removed and placed in a "holding bin" until 3:20pm in the Book Store.  The Student Faculty Board has already met twice to discuss the new policy and any pieces that they feel should be revised.  The SFB is in the process of creating a more effective locker usage system, however, the question is whether students are truly inconvenienced by lockers or just too lazy to return to them in between classes.  How effective the new backpack policy ultimately turns out is yet to be seen, but for now definitely don’t leave bags in the Dolan Center.

Students are having trouble finding out where else to put them.[/caption]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have played Squash for approximately eight years and between the expected competitive tournaments, the training, and the intense exercise, I have come to truly love the sport.  Squash has offered me the opportunity to travel internationally and represent America in Egypt, Germany, Italy, and England.  It has also shaped me into a tough competitor and a focused individual.  Squash is a sport that is exploding in popularity.  It is awaiting the result of the International Olympic Committee's<strong> </strong>compelling bid to become an Olympic sport in 2020.   I wondered why Friends Academy doesn’t have a Squash team and went on a quest to see if there was any way I could start one.

My first stop was to Athletic Director Mr. Quackenbush’s office.  He told me that at one point, Friends did have a small squash club played at Nassau Country Club a couple of times a week.  However, the program eventually died out.  He also filled me in on the requirements for the creation of a revived Squash program.  These requirements include suitable courts and facilities, a Friends Academy representative to chaperone the group, a qualified professional to conduct practices, and other school teams to compete against.

Shortly after meeting with Mr. Quackenbush, I spoke to Muhamed Ali (not the boxer), a local squash professional and former top hundred player in the world.  Ali used to coach the Poly Prep team from Brooklyn.  He made it clear to me that he would be delighted to not only coach our team at the Creek Club courts (a prime facility only five minutes away from Friends) but also to eventually send a squad to the U.S. Squash High School Nationals held annually at Yale.  I will continue to work on forming a squash team and to recruit students to join.  I hope that one day, Friends Academy will both send a small squad to Yale to compete at the High School Nationals and that my passion for the fun and athleticism of the game will spread to others in the community.]]></content:encoded>

</strong>

Doc Schmidt is a legendary English teacher working at Friends Academy. He is an open and friendly man, but how well do you really know your teacher?

&nbsp;

<strong>What is your favorite movie(s)?</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>Who is your favorite superhero?</strong>

"Olivia Fine is my favorite super hero."

&nbsp;

<strong>Why did you choose to work at Friends Academy?</strong>

"So I chose to work at Friends Academy because I was leaving my job in Boston,  and I really love being in big cities, but I also like having a little space I don't want to be necessarily right in the middle of Manhattan.  So I thought this was ideal because I could be close to New York and still have like a nice community that was a little bit removed…  Also, when I came to interview here everybody was incredibly friendly, and students seemed to be really happy and it just seemed to be a really good fit!"

&nbsp;

<strong>Would you consider yourself to be a Type A or Type B personality?</strong>

"I am definitely a type B personality, 100%, not type A."

&nbsp;

<strong>How do you deal with stress?</strong>

"When I am stressed, I surf the internet, I listen to music, usually techno, electro… I don't have a TV, so I don't do that but I do love surfing the web and coming up with funny youtube videos..."

&nbsp;

		<title>The Struggle is Real: an Overview of the First Semester</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["I'm so glad this semester is finally over!” is a phrase that many students uttered after their last class on Friday, January 12th. Teachers and students agree: this semester was demanding, exacting, and unyielding. Final marking periods generally raise stress levels, but why did this semester cause an unusually severe anxiety among members of the community?

The most common explanation regards the abrupt stop in the curriculum caused by Hurricane Sandy. Friends Academy lost almost two weeks of curriculum as a result, confusing lesson plans and test schedules. English teacher Doctor Garrett commented that this period was a “wild and crazy riot.” A two week break with no power, no heat, and no gas left returning students and teachers scrambling to get the courses back on track. <span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span>

After we returned to school, the question was: how could teachers and students recover this long period of having no classes? The solution was to take away vacation days, go to school on Veterans Day, shorten winter break, and remove all the faculty-in-service days. As expected, students were not very fond of the added days to the school year - especially students whose families had scheduled vacations that could not be re-booked. Despite the well-intentioned effort to make up for the lost days, the added days resulted in distress and confusion.

Junior Kara McNelis referred to the semester as “hectic.” She continued to say that first semester “went by fast because of Sandy, but the break gave students less time to catch up on work. Added days didn't help as much as expected because students didn’t come to school, and lesson plans were compromised.”

The challenges of Semester One also raised even greater obstacles for the seniors, as Sandy hit when many Early Decision/action applications were due. Those students applying Early Decision were under high pressure, wondering whether or not admissions offices would extend deadlines due to the disaster. Madame Bevad, French teacher and college advisor, stated, “Colleges were very sensitive. Many deadlines were extended, the College Office made phone calls to colleges, and we even took time in the office when school was closed to assist the seniors in getting back on track. I think we as a school made a good effort to recover days from vacation days.” <span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span>

Senior Sydney Menzin added that the “timing of the storm was extra stressful for seniors. The grades earned for that part of the year get sent to colleges, so students were concerned about things being calculated accordingly.  Luckily, my teachers were very organized and eager to work with us to make sure everything was in order. Thanks to advanced storm warnings, I quickly sent out a couple of my applications beforehand (hoping to avoid a disaster in case of a power outage!). After the first round of deadlines, the college advisors continually made themselves available, even opening the office on a Saturday and during the holiday vacation for students to work on Regular Decision applications.”

The first semester is notoriously stressful for all grades, but this particular semester was especially difficult thanks to Hurricane Sandy. The struggle was real and demanding, but Friends Academy students and teachers managed to make it through.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The day of January 21st, 2013 was historic on many levels. Not only was it the 50th Anniversary of Martin Luther King Day, but it was also the inauguration of President Barack Obama, the nation's first African American president. Despite the cold temperature, people were lined up all the way down the mall to see the President being sworn into office. For the 57th presidential inauguration there were performances by Beyonce, Kelly Clarkson, the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, and James Taylor. A benediction was led by The Reverend Dr. Luis Leon and an original poem was read by Richard Blanco. In his inaugural address, President Obama touched on many important and controversial issues that he hopes to address in his next four years as president, describing his swearing in as such, "My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction – and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service … the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty, or an immigrant realizes her dream.  My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride." Washington was abuzz with people from all socioeconomic statuses, backgrounds, and political parties -- all of whom had come together to recognize and celebrate this historic event.  See the photos for more details of the celebration.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week on Wednesday, January 23rd, Friends Academy students and faculty from all divisions gathered for Peace Week in the lower gym. Peace Week offers a unique time for the whole Friends Academy community to gather together to discuss and reflect on the idea of peace both on a local and global scale. In this first session of community groups, students and faculty were able to establish a stronger sense of camaraderie while engaging in a variety of fun and entertaining games. Following the game playing, each of the community groups brainstormed designs for a few patchwork quilts. Some of these quilts were given to schools in the Far Rockaway community who were affected by Hurricane Sandy. The goal of Peace Week is to not only raise awareness about peace in our immediate Friends Academy community but to also spread awareness in the areas and communities around us.

<em>Below are some pictures of the FA community engaged in Peace Week activities:</em>

		<title>Neverwhere: A Cast Perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Cameron Hellerman and Olivia Fine

The upcoming production of "Neverwhere" is quickly approaching at the end of this week- this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings at 7:30. This Friday afternoon, the Upper School will have the privilege of seeing a matinee of this unbelievable show, which  junior Parker Huseby jokingly describes as,  “not okay for children” and akin to a “modern Macbeth…except better”.

This being the first school production of Neverwhere, the Theater Department has a lot of pressure, as well as excitement, on their shoulders. “The leads [Nick McNiel('13), Tolu Ojo('14), Olivia Youngwall('13), and Tyler Newitt('13)] portray the incredible and mysterious story brilliantly”, said junior Ryan Dobrin. Not only does the set look incredible, but the actors are even better. The cast of the play has to be creative with the usage of the eerie, jungle gym like set. “The set takes the show to a whole new dimension”, explained senior and lead, Olivia Youngwall. Keyonne Session('13) describes how “the crazy sets, the lights, and the costumes are out of this world”.

Every member of the cast has been challenged to push their boundaries. Actors have to climb all the way on top of the stage, on that dauntingly high catwalk seen in morning meetings in the theater.  Sophomore Gloria Fortuna explained how “despite being <em>terrified</em> of heights, it’s been a really good learning experience and [I’ve been] getting much more comfortable”.  The complexity of the set “gives the actors opportunity to explore their acting in a very physical and demanding environment”, said Dobrin. Many members of the large cast have explained how this show in particular has been one of great bonding and triumph, as well as a different area for the department to explore. “All of the hard work that every single person has turned into something that didn’t seem feasible into something spectacular”, Youngwall proclaimed.

This show is unlike <strong>any</strong> that Friends Academy has ever encountered before, and audience members are in for an artistic journey to a breathtaking and scary blending of real and fantastical worlds.

&nbsp;

<strong>COME SEE NEVERWHERE- Thursday Feb 8, Friday Feb 9, and Saturday Feb 10 at 7:30 pm in the Helen A. Dolan Center.</strong>

		<title>Computers: Helpful to Learning? Or a distraction?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="line-height: 1.5;">For many years now at Friends Academy, computers have been an important tool in the learning environment. Although most students find them useful, there are many teachers who still believe that the best way to learn is by pad and paper.</span>

The main issue that teachers have with computers in class is the Internet. While the Internet can be useful at times to access information, it is generally a distraction to learning. Most students cannot concentrate in class when they have the ability to search the web, play games, talk to each other, or any of the other amazing uses that the Internet has.

Most teachers will allow their students to use their computers if they are using them for academic purposes in the beginning of the year. Tenth grade English teacher and advisor Dr. Schmidt stated that it was rather obvious when kids are on their computers, but said that it was their choice to not pay attention.

On the other hand, computers do have their uses. One of the main purposes for which teachers allow computers in the classroom is writing essays. Typing is often more convenient and quick than handwriting, but standardized test prohibit the use of computers so some teachers still make you write essays by hand.

In this age of rapid progression, American youth need to be able to adapt to all the new technology at a rapid pace. When one goes to college, graduate school, and eventually a job, computer use is essentially guaranteed  So if high school is preparing students for these next steps, but in these next steps students are using this new technology, why isn't high school letting students practice using this technology responsibly?

The next step in allowing the computer in school is to find a productive medium. There are a lot of classroom activities where one cannot use a computer yet although many students still try to use their computers. Students do not have teachers' trust with computers yet because all of the new technology on it. In reality, most students know much more about computers than teachers do which also makes them uncomfortable. If students cooperate with teachers while using computers, listen to their rules and put them away when told, teachers will be more inclined to allow computers in the classroom, which would improve the learning environment. But maybe that is a quixotic hope.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Teachers&#039; Responses to Last Week&#039;s Senior Skip Day</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The library was oddly quiet on Monday, February 4th. With over three quarters of the senior student body absent from school, the building enjoyed a rare day of near silence. Yet while the librarians enjoyed the lack of routine “second semester senior sass,” it is obvious that the rest of the school’s administration did not share their relaxed outlook.

The reason for this lack of seniors can be attributed to “Senior Skip Day,” a tradition in many American and Canadian high schools where most of the senior class skip school on a pre-determined day.

But perhaps more interesting than the apparent absence of seniors from the Friends Academy campus was the variety of tactics that teachers used to lure students back into their classrooms. Teachers offered various rewards to students who attended their classes on “Skip Day.” For example, Mrs. Knight told her Calculus students that they would be allowed to work together on a test scheduled for that day if the class had full attendance. Also taking a more positive tack, Mrs. Garry gave her class the opportunity to write a short in-class essay in lieu of a longer one due next Monday, if they were in attendance.

Others used bolder tactics to get students to attend. For instance, Mrs. Clark declared a quiz was in order. The questions on this quiz were unlike other quizzes in that some are unrelated to math. “Do you have graph paper?” “Do you have a calculator?” and “Do you have a pencil?” are some examples. Incredibly, this quiz was worth 2300 points (twenty-three times as much as a typical test). For those who showed up on “Skip Day”, this quiz proved to be an exceptional way to boost to their average. Anyone who skipped on “Skip Day”, however, will have to make up the quiz - except their set of questions will be an considerably more difficult than those presented on “Skip Day”. Unsurprisingly, nearly the entire class showed up.

Mr. Lape took a more retroactive approach, reprimanding his class via email. “You have inconvenienced me and other teachers by your actions. It's only fair and just that you expect inconvenience,” read part of one missive explaining that his students would have to take a missed test the following day before or after school, or during a free block to avoid losing points.

Others were more subtle. “Thank you for my free period.” wrote Mr. Crocco in an email to his students. “At some point before you graduate I will schedule a meeting with those of you absent and never show up. Viva la revolucion.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="line-height: 1.5;">With New York Fashion Week having just ended, fresh looks from popular runway designers are fighting to make it onto the pages of prominent fashion publications. The pages of fashion magazines display the influence of the newest trends from the hottest current designers.  After personally attending the </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">CH by Carolina Herrera</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> fashion show, I noticed that the runway included a variety of looks that included evening wear to resort wear.  The models had simple fresh-faced makeup accompanied by tousled hair with big waves, which works as an everyday look for spring. Also walking in this show was a Friends Academy alumni, Allaire Heisig, who graduated in the Class of 2012. This season, designers are emphasizing both bright colors and simple patterns that can be adapted to fit any stylish spring wardrobe.</span>

		<title>An Exciting Expedition to Malaga and Martinique</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What could be better than traveling abroad to spend an entire week abroad in a warm, beautiful and tranquil country during a cold, dry, and dreary week in winter? During the week of February 18<sup>th</sup><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, the Friends Academy language department had the great opportunity to travel with those FA students who desired to go to Malaga, Spain or the island of Martinique. The purpose of the trip abroad was to allow FA students to learn, study, and embrace the French and Spanish cultures in Malaga or Martinique. After doing a series of interviews with the students and teachers who participated, it seemed as if every student and faculty member had a memorable experience.</span>

Dr. Polly Duke was the French teacher in charge of the trip to Martinique, an overseas region of France in the Caribbean Sea. In order to organize and prepare for the trip, she worked with a Martiniquan exchange program, which allowed for the partnership between FA and the high school le Lycée Schoelcher. Dr. Duke explained that the process, “takes months of communication with parents, travel agents and the partner school to set up an exchange, but it is worth every minute.” When talking about their travel experience, each faculty member and student agreed that travel both down and up to Martinique went very smoothly. The voyagers left midday on Valentine’s Day and took a flight from JFK to San Juan; then left almost immediately on a much smaller plane for Martinique.

Everyone who travelled to Martinique had a blast. Grace Covelli (10), one of the many students who went on the trip, thoroughly emphasized that she “enjoyed embracing the Martiniquan culture and had a wonderful time with her guide, Coralie.” Grace decided to go on the trip because she was eager to get out of the country and experience the 83 degree weather there in Martinique. FA students climbed part of the island’s volcano, Mont Pelée; swam at a volcanic beach and taught English to some orphans and participating in English class with the students of le Lycée Schoelcher. Both Dr. Duke and Grace agreed that the food at the island was different yet delicious. Dr. Duke noted that “the best bread in Martinique is similar to the French baguette and one specialty on the island is conch, which is called 'lambi.'" Grace had her own encounter with “bloody sausage.” She said that it was, "unappealing in both name and sight, but they were not as terrible as they're chalked up to be.”

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">When asked about their general feelings about the Martiniquan culture, both Doctor Duke and Grace felt that the consensus of the country is carefree and collective. Dr. Duke said," the </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Martiniquais are able to sit, relax, communicate with each other, and eat well. While people work hard, there is a greater emphasis on living well. There is a saying: “Bosser moins pour vivre mieux” which means “work less to live better.” Ultimately, their work is just as efficient, it just includes more obvious and very welcome down time."</span>

Switching gears to the Malaga trip, Mr. Posada and Mrs. Carballo were the two faculty members who went on the trip. The trip was organized through the program Prometeur, which helped find a host school and host families. The program also scheduled the day trips that the students and faculty took to Granada, Sevilla, and Cordoba. Both the students and teachers thought the flight to Malaga was extremely long. The flight took 10 hours total. The travelers also flew from JFK and then to Zurich, Switzerland where they had a bit of a layover, but from there they were able to finally fly to Malaga.

Brittany Kriegstein (12),  had the opportunity to go on the trip and she said, “She didn’t want to leave.” She also enjoyed her “incredible host family, the delicious food, and all the nice people” that she met. When I asked the students to describe the culture at Malaga, each one noted that the people had a much laid back lifestyle, which FA students noted is immensely dissimilar to the hectic routines that we Americans are accustomed to having. Cameron Hellerman (10), another student who went on the trip said, “the kids were so much more relaxed with school, the parents seemed less stressed, and when you walked the streets you really felt the friendly atmosphere everywhere.” Some memorable moments were going to see a soccer game, trying various new foods, spending time with the students in their classrooms, shopping, and staying with the homestay families.

Through the experiences of the both the teachers and the students, the travel abroad programs that were offered this past February break were remarkable. Both the students and teachers were able to gain a greater deal of knowledge about French and Spanish countries. Therefore, it is fair to say that during a cold week in February there could be nothing better to do than travel abroad to a warm and sunny place, such as Martinique or Malaga Spain.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2013 Friends Academy is looking to bounce back from a poor 2012 season with only 4 wins. Friends Academy baseball has a lot to look forward to. This team has many young players along with only graduating 2 players last year. Many of the players are very excited for this season and have many high hopes.

Head Coach, Marshal Linder, preaches to his team every day telling them that they are a better team than last year. He is very confident in his team and is even hoping to win a conference championship this year something that has not been done in Friends Academy Baseball since 2005. He feels that winning a conference is a harder achievement than winning states so he encourages his team to achieve the greatest goal because he thinks they are good enough.

Friends Academy’s powerhouse line up is centered around senior Alek Kucich. Not only does he hit for average but also he can hit for plenty of power. Along with his tremendous hitting he is an excellent defensive catcher, probably the best in the league and an impressive base runner. After talking to him, he told me “I think that our team is young but very eager to win and get better and from the words of Bane: the fire rises.”

This preseason friends has played 5 scrimmages and impressively won them all without breaking a sweat. They beat opponents like rival Glen Cove, conference opponent locust valley, and higher seeded Great Neck South. Friends Academy is the team to beat this year coming in strong to the real season and winning their first game in blowout fashion. At the end of this season they will be graduating 6 seniors, 3 of which are starters so this is their best shot to make a run at the championships. They are projected to be an exciting team to watch this year so be prepared for an eventful season from Friends Academy Baseball.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>With additional reporting by Will Duke, Olivia Fine and Cameron Hellerman</em>

On a testing day several years ago, Mrs. Clark noticed something awry as her students silently plodded through an exam. Later investigation revealed that one student had copied formulas onto an eraser, and was using this “cheat sheet” while others, of course, had no such advantage. “I had had a good relationship with the student, and this [incident] really hurt that,” Mrs. Clark recalls. She has caught other students trying to get by in this manner: one with an index card in a sweatshirt pocket, another blatantly looking at someone else’s quiz. “Now I make sure that all things are gone, desks are clear, backpacks are zipped.” Not even tissues are safe from this kind of scrutiny, let alone Starbucks cups and crumpled cough drop wrappers.

A situation like this is certainly not unique to Friends Academy; similar scenes abound at schools and universities around the globe. Academic cheating, defined broadly as trying to pass someone else’s work for one’s own, is currently a highly explored piece of our educational fabric. A recent study at Stanford University reported that 75-98% of college students surveyed each year admit to having cheated in some way during high school. In the past few months, cheating scandals at very prestigious institutions—including Harvard University and Stuyvesant High School in New York City—have made headlines. And the infamous pay-for-play SAT ring has rocked standardized testing administration across the country from its discovery point in Great Neck.

As the names of other schools are publicized and criticized for the cheating scandals that sweep their halls, questions persist about how exactly cheating manifests itself within the Friends Academy community. With its competitive environment and prestigious reputation, Friends theoretically presents the perfect climate for academic cheating on both a large and small scale. Its location on the North Shore of Long Island further seals its fate: this is a region where success is prized above all else and competitive fires are fueled from early ages. So what is the level of academic honesty at Friends? Do Quaker values help to uphold the principles of integrity, or does the pressure of high achievement cause students to buckle? An anonymous survey conducted of all high school students brought to light some interesting information about the true nature of cheating at Friends.

Out of the Upper School’s 379 students, 117 completed the cheating survey, with fair representation from each grade level. For the purpose of the survey, cheating was defined as any and all of the following: Copying another student’s homework, looking at another student’s answers while taking a test, carrying notes into a test, sharing test hints or answers in between classes, plagiarism and the employment of someone else to do homework or write essays. About 82% of students who participated in the survey had witnessed cheating at Friends, with most citing a frequency of once or twice a semester. From the five core disciplines, History was ranked with the highest percentage of cheating observed, followed by Math. Language rounded out the list of core disciplines with the lowest amount of observable cheating, followed by the Arts where most students felt that cheating was nonexistent.

In the next section of the survey, students were asked to check off the cheating methods that they felt most applied to them as students at Friends. Out of all students who completed this section, the highest number—47.2%, translated into 58 students—admitted to giving test hints to others taking the exam at a later time. Homework copiers emerged a close second, with 44.7%, or 55 students. In a box attached to this question where students were able to submit feedback if they so wished, one student simply wrote “phones.” Does this mean that Friends Academy students are using phones to pass along assessment information? If so, it seems that Mrs. Clark’s clean-desk zipped-bag method is the way to go. Surprisingly, only 3.3% of students, 4 in all, admitted to plagiarism of any sort; the lowest representation of the cheating categories. This data points out that small-scale cheating is most common at Friends, despite some students’ assumptions that plagiarism happens more often. While homework copying and test answer sharing may happen daily and discreetly, plagiarism is possibly the method of cheating most frequently caught by teachers, and its gravity as an academic offense means that incidents of it are made more public throughout the community.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cheatingarticlechart3.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3109" title="cheatingarticlechart3" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cheatingarticlechart3.png" alt="" width="720" height="493" /></a></p>
Perhaps the most telling question of the survey chronicled students’ reasons for cheating. Just about all of the cheating research currently being done by experts across the world cite pressure as the primary factor that propels students to cheat. But pressure is an enormous and multifaceted force, a reality that doesn’t always stem from our school systems. Rather, pressure is often homegrown, planted at family dinner tables (or rushed meals in transit between extracurriculars) and cultivated at homework desks and college tours. “Cheating happens here because of pressure,” states Mr. Posada. The Friends student body agreed with him: 81% of the 116 students who answered this question cited “pressure for good grades” as their main reason for cheating. Laziness, overscheduling, procrastination and pressure from parents ranked next all hovering around percentages in the high 40s, and pressure from self at 36% was followed by pressure from teachers at 26%. “Students are busy, tired, and (especially at a school like FA) are extremely pressured,” wrote a student in the response section. “…Its just that in a community that is stressful…students tend (involuntarily) to look at the other kid’s test while taking a test or even [have] the tendency to copy one’s homework.”

This pressure-cooker culture has not materialized out of thin air. Rather, it is the product of impossible standards that are advertized by colleges and universities—arguably the most highly revered institutions in this country. “It comes from the top,” says Mrs. Clark. And then it trickles down, combining with skewed images of “successful” individuals to create parents that push and kids that cheat. This year alone was one of the most difficult years on record for college acceptances, with hundreds of thousands of applicants rejected from schools on the basis of standardized testing scores that were “not quite there.” In too many cases, differences of twenty points separated the “accepted” pile from the “look elsewhere” pile. When that much is at stake, it is little wonder that honesty is sometimes suspended in order to attain the superhuman heights of achievement that seem to be necessary these days. “People are so concentrated on the end result, that all else is justified,” explains Mr. Dugger. Each year, he is handed at least one essay that has clearly been written by a hired professional. Good college essays can cost thousands of dollars, and can be very helpful in securing acceptance to a school that may otherwise have rejected that particular applicant. Last year, he saw duplicates of the same one—submitted by different students. In an effort to create a more efficient business, these college writing experts seem to be erring on the side of carelessness.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cheatingarticlechart5.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3108" title="cheatingarticlechart5" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cheatingarticlechart5.png" alt="" width="720" height="540" /></a></p>
In many ways, though, the Quaker principles of Friends Academy seem to stand firmly against the torrent of negative corner-cutting messages. Does Friends Academy’s tremendous emphasis on personal integrity work to steer some students away from a cheating path they may otherwise be tempted to take? “Most students make this decision in a moment of panic…at that point, mental ‘stop’ signs aren’t seen very clearly,” notes Mr. Morris. “It’s that moment of panic at 2 A.M. when a paper is due the next day. Do I copy and paste, or not?” echoes Mr. Baskind. Of course, some students may be under more pressure than others, and some may be more predisposed to have a cheating mentality. On the survey, 64% of students admitted to cheating between two and five times throughout their Friends Academy careers. This number was significantly higher then the runner-up—once during a student’s career at Friends with 19.5%. “Is it easier to cheat the second or third time?” asks Mr. Morris. The survey data shows that to be likely.

The effects of Friends Academy values can truly be observed on the survey’s eighth question, which asked students whether or not they thought cheating to be an acceptable behavior. Out of 119 students who answered, 93, or 78%, acknowledged that cheating is not acceptable under any circumstances. Almost seventeen percent responded that cheating is acceptable under certain circumstances, and a mere five percent answered that cheating is always acceptable. Although students do occasionally cheat, they at least recognize the immorality of their actions, likely thanks to some aspect of their education in Quaker ideals. It seems that outside elements, not inner convictions, drive academic cheating. In a response box that asked students to elaborate on circumstances where cheating may be considered acceptable, one student responded: “When parents tell me the grades are the bottom line.” Again, achievement above all, at all costs, no matter the moral or monetary price. “Judicial board has reminded me that students get bombarded with far more messages about achievement than they do about integrity,” says Mr. Baskind. In the middle of Long Island’s North Shore, which can sometimes feel like a glorified shark tank, high achievement is often deemed the only way to survive.

Not only do students sink or swim in this manner, but schools do as well. Friends seeks to distinguish itself from other schools through its adherence to Quaker principles, with mixed results. Certainly, the core ideals of integrity and respect already work as significant preventatives for student cheating, especially in its more morally compromising forms. “I’ve seen fewer instances here of conspiracies among groups of students to cheat. In other schools, there are more instances of students working in conjunction,” Mr. Morris says. In fact, at Stuyvesant, the cheating scandal <em>was</em> a conspiracy—students supported each other in what was basically a big collaborative project that helped them to meet the intense demands of the school. Whole classes worked together to pass along test answers in complex ways that, if nothing else, showcased the ingenuity of the students and their willingness to combat the oppressive force of Stuyvesant pressure.

Another thing that sets Friends apart from public schools in the world of cheating is the connectedness that students feel to the school. The Independent School Health Check, or ISHC, is an annual survey that examines academic honesty, student motivation, and other issues in private and public schools around the country. According to the ISHC data, a high percentage of independent school students feel connected to their academic environments, feel supported by their teachers and take interest in what they are learning. Public school students, on the other hand, are less likely to feel that sense of connectedness. By combining several collections of data, the ISHC was able to come up with these numbers: 19.4% of students with a high connection score cheat, 28% of students with a moderate score cheat, and 42.3% of students with a low connection score cheat. Therefore, the more a student feels welcomed and satisfied by his academic community, the less he is likely to engage in academic dishonesty. The nurturing environment of Friends Academy fosters a high sense of connectedness that may act as a natural deterrent to cheating.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Cheatingarticlegraph1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3107" title="Cheatingarticlegraph1" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Cheatingarticlegraph1.png" alt="" width="720" height="540" /></a></p>
So cheating does occur at Friends, frequently enough to be significant but not as often as at some other schools. Knowing this, what can the Friends Academy community do to reduce cheating levels even further? In order to effectively combat cheating within the school environment, teachers first have to be aware of its many different forms. The last question on the anonymous survey asked students whether they thought that Friends Academy teachers had a good grasp on the cheating that occurs at the school. The response was mixed: the highest percentage of students—37.9%—believe that some teachers do not have a clear idea, while 34% seemed to think that most teachers do have a clear idea. At 27%, fewer students felt that most teachers at Friends did not have a clear idea about cheating. If teachers seek a cheating-free academic environment, they will have to find ways to get a better sense of the cheating that occurs on a day-to-day basis. This way, all teachers can act consistently to eradicate academic dishonesty within their individual classrooms.

Beyond firmly outlining classroom rules and carefully monitoring all exams, there are a variety of ways that teachers at Friends can work to prevent opportunities for cheating. “Teachers should use different tests for different classes,” Mr. Nelson suggests. “There need to be more in-class assessments,” stresses Mrs. Clark, although Mr. Nelson expresses a yearning to be able to assign more take-home essays and papers. He underscores the importance of the revision process in students’ work: ideally, students could complete a writing assignment at home, bring it to class for editing, and then have more time at home to think about it. But in a world where parents and tutors write essays for students, where brilliant sentences are available at the mere click of a mouse, this assignment style may now be practically impossible.

Instead of focusing on what the school does not do to prevent cheating, Mr. Morris focuses on what the school does to cause it. He feels that students usually cheat because there is some kind of “imbalance” in their lives. “As a school, we have to evaluate how we contribute to that imbalance,” he says. Does this mean that less homework is the answer? “I went to an all-girls school, the top one in the city. We had maybe twenty minutes of homework a night,” Mrs. Clark recalls. Less homework would presumably reduce the overscheduling problem, allowing kids to focus on relaxation time or extracurricular activities after school instead of trying to cram everything into a day that simply isn’t long enough. Or maybe the school should try to move away from fact-based, AP style testing. These solutions could help, but the conservative tenets of the Friends Academy community would make such progressive changes difficult to implement.

In reality, an individual school, Friends Academy included, may have little control over student cheating, for academic dishonesty is ultimately a consequence of the direction in which the American education system is heading. Higher standards than ever push for curriculums that are increasingly dense, translating into more and more information that students have to remember and regurgitate. All aspects of the education system are increasingly numbers-driven: standardized tests scores drive teacher salaries and determine college acceptances. In the past few weeks, a group of public school teachers in Atlanta, Georgia were found to have changed wrong answers on students’ standardized tests to correct ones, fueled by the higher paychecks that higher scores would yield.

The numbers game is not just affecting students, then, but at least some educators as well, setting a deplorable example for the children who may have looked up to them. But the world thinks numerically these days: things are faster, words are smaller, and fingertip accessibility has contributed to a global sense of impatience. Mr. Nelson believes that “consistent written and verbal feedback” would be a better way to evaluate students than simple grades and scores. At the same time, he laments that “it’s a lot easier to explain to a parent that a kid is an 82% than to say that the kid has trouble analyzing text.” So essays are boiled down to numerical scores; student’s efforts translate into percentages. With the passage of new statistics-based legislation, the trend appears ripe to continue.

In the tangled monstrosity that is the world of academic cheating, gray areas remain. The same Stanford study that reported today’s astronomical percentage of confessed high school cheaters also claimed that only 20% of college students admitted to cheating in high school in the 1940s. Is this because of modern pressures, or is cheating just easier nowadays?

Perhaps not coincidentally, other recent studies have shown that student empathy at the college level is at an all-time low. Is this, too, caused by the cutthroat competition that now governs kids’ lives from an early age? At two years old, children in New York City are already battling each other for admission to preschools. Then they go through life, constantly hoping that the failure of others will add more points to the curve or place them in a higher percentile. These students rely on survival instincts to make it through their academic careers, and suddenly the entire educational process looks like a bad remake of <em>The</em> <em>Hunger</em> <em>Games</em>. But at the end of the movie, collaboration prevails. Maybe this is an important message: instead of separating and policing students more actively than ever before, perhaps educators should be harnessing the power of students working together. In an increasingly complex world, this could be the best answer to the troubling dilemmas that modern education engenders.

In the past few weeks, the song “Feel This Moment,” a duet between Pitbull and Christina Aguilera, has enjoyed a spot on iTunes’ top ten list. Without a doubt, a significant number of Friends Academy students helped its success by downloading it onto their iPods and streaming it through their headphones in the library’s Quiet Reading Area. In addition to Pitbull’s catchy verse and Aguilera’s powerful refrain, the song features something else: the instrumental hook from band A-ha’s 1985 hit “Take On Me.” Essentially copied and pasted into the song, the loop adds a bit of nostalgia, and acts as another dimension that makes the song arguably better than it would have been otherwise. There are a lot of good ideas out there. If this song was praised for its borrowing of an old note sequence, why can’t students incorporate ideas that they admire into essays and papers? In this modern age, compilations of the new and the old may only intensify. There is, however, a fine line between collaboration and criminal activity, the battle over authenticity and authorship.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[	On April 6th 2013, Friends Academy’s Zach Sulzman went to the Pembroke Academy in New Hampshire for a robotics competition. This is the first time that Friends Academy has ever enlisted in a robotics competition and came back very successful with the first place honors. 
	In this competition everyone has his or her own robots. They are given about 40 bean bags and have to pick them up and place them in 18”x18” boxes. There are 3 different levels of boxes: floor, regular, and high. For every beanbag that is placed in a floor box it counts as 1 point, the regular box counts as 5 points, and the high box counts as 10 points. The regular box was about 20 inches off the ground and the high box was about 35 inches off the ground. The person controlling the robot can choose which box he or she would want to drop their bean bags in. If you drop the beanbag and it’s not inside a box you are not allowed to pick it up so it is a risk trying to go for the higher boxes. 
	Before Zach could go to New Hampshire to compete in the regional finals, he needed to win at qualifiers at Hofstra week before. Zach came in second in this competition but was very close to the first seed. The top 3 robots qualified to go to New Hampshire so Zach earned his place in regionals.
	When Zach was at regionals there were about 30 teams there. Friends Academy being new to the program only had 1 robot on their team but most teams had 2 or 3 robots. There were about 100 different robots in total. 
	I had the pleasure to talk to Zach about this competition. He told me that he was surprised to win. He was nervous going into the competition but he brought his a game. He took the risk and did not use any of the floor boxes because he knew if he wanted to win he would have to use the regular and high boxes. 
	Zach Sulzman went to New Hampshire for Friends Academy and brought home the gold. We look forward to see our reigning champion go back to the competition to try for a repeat.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/us/boston-marathon-explosions/index.html">CNN</a>, approximately four hours into the annual Boston Marathon, two bombs exploded killing three people and wounding 260 more. Two weeks have passed since the attack, and most of the questions regarding why it occurred remain unanswered. Directly following the tragedy, FBI agents scoured over hundreds of thousands of submitted photos of the area.  Investigators soon identified Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as the suspected bombers.

Ms. Scudellari said, “It has been an extremely difficult process to cope and heal from these events, which also lead to the realization that nonsensical violence, freak accidents, or random acts of terror may happen at any place or time.  Fear and tragedy should not deter one's way of life but make one stronger and more determined to do good for others.  It seems that the recent reaction of the community in Boston (and globally) is a testament to this sound piece of advice."

The Colorado movie theater shooting, Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, and now the Boston bombings are just some of the numerous tragedies that occurred this past year. These horrendous events opened many Americans’ eyes to an existing false sense of security.<strong> </strong> The recent bombings in Boston evoked many old feelings of discomfort and fear for many people. The Boston bombings are the first major terrorist attack by non-United States citizens since 9/11. Investigators have found evidence that suggests that Tamerlan, now deceased, self-radicalized when he was<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/us/shot-at-boxing-title-denied-tamerlan-tsarnaev-reeled.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank"> denied the opportunity to compete in the national Tournament of Champions in 2011 because he was not a United States citizen</a>.

Mr. Alber commented, “The bombings in Boston brought back many of the same feelings I had as a result of the September 11th tragedy; the initial confusion about what had happened.  I feel sad and angry about what we have lost as a result of these terrorist attacks. Because in spite of our desire not to let these events change our lives - our lives have changed drastically since 9/ll.”

While much of the Friends Academy community was not directly affected by the bombings last week, many faculty members and students are speaking up about their reactions to this tragic event.

For Senor Posada, the bombings did, in fact, hit close to home. “Last Friday I frantically waited to hear news from my brother Freddy and his young family who live up in Boston. I was very worried thinking of them. On Saturday morning, I finally heard the news that it so happens that the second bomber, Dzhokhar, was apprehended a few blocks away from where my brother and his family live in Watertown.”

The media has speculated considerably about the Tsarnaev brothers' Islamic faith and what part it had to play in their actions, which has led to unjustified suspicion and discrimination against peaceful muslims. <a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/24/dont-punish-muslims-for-boston-attack/?iref=allsearch">Muslims as a whole are certainly not to blame for the Boston attack</a>; two radicalized individuals who practiced violent jihad are to blame.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> As a Quaker school, Friends Academy preaches peace and non-violent resolution, which is why the bombings are especially upsetting to the community because they go against our Quaker principles. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Mr. Scardina shared his Quaker wisdom with the Inkwell, "As a Quaker, any act of senseless violence only strengthens my resolve to find peaceful solutions to future conflicts. As in 9-11, we must be committed to healing with the victims of tragedy and also avoid creating more victims by breaking the cycle of revenge. This is a tall order - especially in light of our national anxiety since 9-11, Sandy Hook, Boston, and countless other unfathomable events - but for me it is the only path with justice and love for all."</span>

Mr. Lape commented, “I think that it's tragic that two young men whose families came to this country to escape Russian violence aimed at crushing a Chechyan independence movement would be seduced by an ideology of hate that sees the United States as a satanic force imperializing the world for greed and lust, when so many immigrants of diverse ethnicities and religions have embraced an American identity rooted in universal values of equality and freedom.”

When tragic events occur, people can become frightened and doubt their security.  However, sometimes it is events as horrible and shocking as the Boston bombing that unify a community through its peoples' incredible acts in response to such a crisis.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Your Donations at Work?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="line-height: 1.5;">“Relay! Relay! Relay! Register for Relay! Donate to Relay! Come out and Support!”  We have heard these demanding statements hundreds of times. As we all know, Relay for Life is approaching rather rapidly, and the urge for registration and a flux of new participants is greatly advocated.  However, the real question is why? Why do we need to donate to relay? What will going to Relay really accomplish and where do our donations go to?</span>

First and foremost, what exactly is a relay event? Relay for Life is an organized overnight community fundraising walk where members of designated teams of people walk around a track for a certain period of time. Food, games, and activities are offered as well to provide entertainment. Included with these activities are a luminaria ceremony, survivors lap, and a fight back ceremony. These periods are considered an emotional time of reflection for the survivors, caregivers, and family members who have lost loved ones. While Relay for life is a wonderful community building and encouraged rally, many questions have been raised about the exact locations involving “donor dollars.”

Have you noticed that nowhere on the Relay for Life website does it tell you where your donations are going? Many participants of the event do not notice this simply because they are distracted by the hype for the event. Other participate assume that their donations are going directly to their specific cancer or their specific cause. However that is not the case. Your donations, in fact, do help and contribute to the hoped eventual decay against cancer, but many participants would like to know how?

In an interview between <a href="http://www.wtflungcancer.com/where-do-your-relay-for-life-donations-go-american-cancer-society-doesnt-tell-you/">Jennifer Windrum</a> and a representative from the American Cancer society, information about your donation locations was revealed. After Jennifer asks, <strong>“</strong>When someone participates in a Relay for Life event, can they designate their donation dollars to a specific cancer? If not, where, specifically, do these event dollars go?” The representative states that the donations are brought to a “general fund to be allocated where the need is greatest and where we have the most critical opportunities to make a difference in the fight against cancer and help people and families facing the disease.” So, in retrospect, donators will not really know exactly where their money is going. Instead they just have to hope and or assume that the “general fund” where their money is contributed will in fact be used effectively.

In the interview the representative does state that the society is aware of the inefficiencies of the website and they do acknowledge some donor frustration. Supposedly, the association is working to perfect the issue. The representative states, “The American Cancer Society publishes an Annual Report and makes our financial statements available every year on cancer.org: http://bit.ly/l8WMS7. Our strategic plan and annual progress report also shows the lifesaving work that our donors’ dollars make possible.” On the Relay website, The<strong> </strong>American Cancer Society has also included a tab titled, “Where the dollars go”, so progress is evident, but the issue is still a little unclear.

Relay for life is in fact a life changing event that allows others to see how much cancer has affected the lives of many. However, the event and organization would definitely be more inciting if participants and or donors had more sufficient information given, rather than just being satisfied that your money goes to a “general fund.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Saturday, the Friends Academy community came together to honor those with cancer at our 2<sup>nd</sup> annual Relay For Life. The smaller, more intimate group of participants this year strolled the Luminaria walkway, danced Zumba, sang, and played dodge ball and videogames.  As noted by many students and teachers at Friends, this year's Relay for Life was a success.  A variety of students shared what their favorite part of Relay was, and what the Relay committee should change for next year.  A few noted how the track should be opened next year, including Bel Evans (’15) and Jack Statfeld (’15).  Elana Pinto (’15) and Kira Sanchez (’13) both loved the Zumba. “I really enjoyed the Zumba because it was funny to watch fellow students dance and participate” said Pinto. Sanchez, one of the student coordinators of Relay also said how Zumba was “fun, hilarious… and sweaty.” One of Tony Cortese’s (’15) favorite activities was watching kids come and sing at the open mic, “Next year we should have John O’Brien (’13) come back and sing, I thought that was real funny.” It seems that everyone truly enjoyed the Luminaria ceremony this year.  Students expressed how they felt the group came together as a united community, not only at that time but also throughout the entire evening. Sanchez explained that the Relay committee's goal was to achieve this feeling of unity- “The first year we did relay everything was spread out too far… we felt it would bring a greater sense of community to the night and a more intimate feel for everyone participating.”

Some rumors circulated that Friends Academy and the American Cancer Society were in a disagreement because last year’s Relay event was not exactly to their qualifications.  Mr. Morris commented on whether or not this rumor was true- “Philosophically, there is a different sense of what [Relay] should be. American Cancer Society has a template for these events. They have a hard time understanding from our point of view, it’s really about the community, and about having the opportunity for students and families to participate in something together.” As everyone who attended the event noticed, there was a significantly less amount of people who participated than the inaugural event. Mr. Morris, Mr. Baskind, and the Student Life Committee have ideas for change, “There is a question going forward, whether or not to work with [the American Cancer Society] specifically around this kind of event. Maybe [we could be] doing an event that involves a Relay-like element as well as elements of other service our students are doing. Just take a night as a community to celebrate service in general.” Mr. Morris said.

As we go forward into the next school year, Mr. Morris says the Friends Academy community will “definitely have an evening with a similar feel”. Certainly these two nights have been a favorite in the FA community, but don’t expect a conventional Relay For Life event again, maybe a more Quaker approach, “Relay For Service.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bromance at Friends Academy</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2013/10/22/bromance-at-friends-academy/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When someone mentions the name Friends Academy, several things come to mind: the advanced academics, the preppy students, and the community service opportunities. However, there exists one more aspect in the Friends Academy community that is not fully noted: the bromance. Bromance is defined as the non-sexual love and affection shared between two male friends. Many boys do not even realize that they have bromances. When asked about his friendships with other boys, one male student standing in the Quad replied, “I have never thought of us [my friends and myself] as having a bromance, but I do understand where the term comes from. I am very passionate about my guy friends. They are my brothers and I love them.”

Ironically enough, the bromances that exist in Friends Academy's culture are not recognized among Friends Academy students; yet many students who do not attend the Academy believe that the relationship between male guy friends is especially close compared to those at their own schools.

The bromances that exist at Friends Academy are a direct result of the tight and loyal community that the faculty ensure and demonstrate.  The environment is tight-knit in the sense that every male student can approach any other male and talk to them, even if they do not have a close relationship.  Junior Matthew Feinstein explained, “Only at school do I feel like I am able to approach any guy and start a conversation even if I’ve only talked to them once or twice in my life.” The faculty and administration have created an environment where the students are constantly interacting with each other and feel as close to one another as if they have known each other since lower school.

Many male students at Friends Academy have similar views on disputes between two guys. The arguments may last a week but are resolved soon after because the bromance that exists allows boys to forgive each other and focus on more important things, such as schoolwork.

The bromances that exist in the Friends Academy community should not be underestimated.  Although bromances are played down by most, teachers and female students should not underestimate the necessity and importance of close friendships between males for their success and happiness.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Shout Out to the Freshmen</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After pulling through the first two tough months of school and surviving a rainy outdoor education trip, the freshman class is back and better than ever. Although this freshman class has a particularly confident group of students, the majority had some fears before coming into the Upper School. Interviews with many of the freshmen revealed a great deal about what they felt. Junior Varsity soccer star Catherine Lori said, “If there was anything I’m nervous for, it is SATs and ACTs. I am a little nervous about abiding by the rules of the upper school. It definitely is a big change from being the leaders of one school, and being a lowest point of another.” Connor Febesh said, “I like the freedom I have and the ability to do what I want. It sure is good to have free time to do things I want such as having this interview.”

No matter the environment, transitioning from middle school to upper school is daunting, but imagine making this change in a completely new community and a new social environment.  First year Friends Academy freshman, Sabrina Schamroth explained,  “I was not too nervous about being in a new school, although I was a little nervous about going into high school.” The freshmen have already discovered quite a bit about each other<strong>.</strong>

Now, the freshmen are practically at home. They are involved in sports and theatre, and participated in spirit week by decorating the quad as a "Freshmen Fiesta."  The Class of 2017 is already demonstrating its desire to play a big role in the Friends Academy community. Spirit Week's twitter competition made their eagerness apparent when, with the help of Mr. Helpern, the Freshmen nearly out-tweeted the Seniors. Love them or hate them, the freshmen have a great four years ahead and would like to extend big thank you to the Upper class-men for helping the freshmen feel more comfortable in their new enviroment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the chilly autumn breeze came Friends Academy's Fall Fair. Each year, students look forward to the usual attractions such as thrilling rides, Gideon’s Attic, and dunking Mr. Morris in the dunk tank. This year the fair featured many new and exciting activities. The Tressed Out hair styling booth, a pristine addition, offered hair coloring and fun extensions. Bibity Bopity Boo, a charming princess themed booth, kept younger siblings occupied while their parents and siblings mingled.

The culinary booths also added some delicious treats this year. From a slushy machine to Friends Academy’s homemade hot sauce, everybody found tasty foods.

Gideon’s Attic sold five thousand pairs of luxury brand shoes, featuring Stuart Weitzman, Tommy Hilfiger, and Michael Kors. For those who planned on purchasing stylish school shoes for the fall, Gideon's Attic was the perfect opportunity to buy designer shoes for a great cause at an amazing price.

The Senior Homecoming Dance after the bonfire on Friday night was an incredible success. With a white-out theme, the entire upper school came together for an amazing night of dancing and fun. Students immensely enjoyed the DJ blasting music not only during the dance but for the entirety of the bonfire!

The Friends Academy community thanks all who contributed their time and effort to make the dance and the fair a huge success and well-anticipated tradition.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This fall, Friends Academy will present William Shakespeare’s play, <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em>. <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em>, or "2GOV" as the cast members nicknamed the show, is about two men who fall in love with two different girls.  The play includes the issues and betrayals that surround both young loves.  The plot of <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em> parallels events that occur here at Friends Academy. Upon hearing that the theater cast will be putting on a Shakespeare production, many people shy away from the play because they are intimidated.  To address this concern, the Friends Academy Theater and Dance Department decided to revamp one of Shakespeare’s original plays by adding 1980s music hits, some of which the Seniors played on the Quad during spirit week.

The director, Andrew Geha, explained this interpretation of the show, “1980s music just kind of screamed out.  There is a kind of flightiness and an overblown quality to the decisions that the characters make, that matches the melodramatic, overblown qualities of '80s music and popular culture.”

Mr. Geha highlighted the lesser known Shakespeare play with specific lyrics of songs that correspond with the plot and the characters’ desires.  Specifically, the song “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)" by the Proclaimers “made perfect sense."  The song fits well with the personality of the main character, Julia (played by Sierra Fisher ’15).  Mr. Geha hopes that the 1980s theme will attract more students and parents as well as prove that Shakespeare can be translated into popular culture.  Shakespeare's play “isn’t as hard to understand as many people assume.”

All students and parents are encouraged to see the show <strong>November 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> at 7:30 p.m. in the Dolan Center.  </strong>Students will have the opportunity to see what their peers look like in 1980s clothing, wigs, and makeup, while songs by Bon Jovi, Queen, and Michael Jackson will be featured.  <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em> is sure to be a vibrant, refreshing, exciting show that makes Shakespeare fun, and also allows songs like Jessie’s Girl to make a comeback at Friends Academy.

		<title>Giving Back in the Friends Academy Community</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Community service is an imperative, essential, and significant mission at Friends Academy. Students are consistently encouraged to get involved and invest time into the community because giving back strengthens Friends Academy as a whole. Furthermore, volunteer work benefits everybody who is involved.  Helping others makes people healthier: moods are brightened and joy is radiated.  Volunteers experience an indescribable, warm, happy feeling. Community service is not only advantageous for the person being helped, but also for the person performing the service.  Giving back to the community allows students to learn a lot about themselves and discover hidden talents.  Students may also acquire new knowledge of the Friends Academy community and share this knowlegde with others.  This ultimately raises more awareness of issues that are relevant to all students. Above all, volunteering gives students a chance to help individuals and organizations that otherwise would not receive needed support. With this purpose in mind, Friends Academy's students must take advantage of the school's wide range of opportunities to do service.

W.A.T.C.H. is the most popular major club at Friends Academy.  The acronym stands for "We Are The Community Helpers."  Maggie Brennan, the Clerk of W.A.T.C.H. explains that the club “helps promote and organize the service opportunities offered at Friends Academy as well as any community service initiative within our community."  Brennan strongly encourages that, “students come out to our service opportunities because they are quick activities that help locally and are so much fun. Whether it is helping a little third grader with his math homework at the Boys and Girls Club, making sandwiches for the Men's Shelter or doing art projects with the SCO kids, it is guaranteed that students will have a great time and feel like they really helped and made an impact after.”  Friends Academy even provides transportation to the Glen Cove Boys and Girl Club, which is only an estimated 5-10 minute drive away.  If students prefer to stay on campus, they can participate in sandwich making, Art with Friends, Music Therapy, or Sports Night. A final thought from Brennan is sure to inspire students and faculty at Friends Academy. “I encourage anyone in our community to try service in some shape or form! We can all make such a difference by just helping out locally!”

&nbsp;

Schedule of Community Service for Interested Students:

Glen Cove Boys and Girls Club: Monday-Wednesday, 3:30-5:00 (bus transportation provided)

Sandwich Making: Wednesday, 3:10-3:30, in the Cafeteria

Sports Night: Wednesday, 6:00-7:00, in the Field House

Art With Friends: Thursday, 4:00-4:45, in the Art Studio

Music Therapy: Thursday, 4:00-4:45, in the Music Studio]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Class Representative" is a title many people desire but few people receive.

The Freshmen recently experienced the process of voting for fellow peers as school leaders for the first time. The excitement rippled through the Meeting House when nine candidates took center stage and spoke directly to the student body. Though all the speeches were persuasive and powerfully spoken, only four students could fill the spots as class representatives. Congratulations to Catherine Lori, Danny McCooey, Max Evans, and Matty Feinstein for their election to the Student Council as the Freshmen representatives. These individuals are slowly becoming more familiar with their roles.  Now, students can approach the elected representatives about concerns that pertain to the class as a whole.

9th grade student Elizabeth Panacciulli, voiced her opinion on the issue of cell phones and stated, "By giving us restrictions (on cell phone use), it makes us more likely to break the rules. We should be allowed to use them."  Another freshman, Jacob Hutt, voiced his opinion, "I believe that [study halls] should not be forced. Sometimes I don't have work or others don't have work and they distract me from doing my own.  I also believe the cell phone policy should be changed so that you can check your schedule anywhere. People like me use their cell phones to see their schedules and can't go to the library between classes to see what they have next."

The cell phone policy, the legitimacy of study halls and many other pressing topics are currently being discussed by the Student Council.  Students should not be shy to speak up and share their opinions. The Student Council's goal is to improve the Upper School community, and they cannot accomplish this task without hearing common obstacles and issues. The Freshmen warmly wish the newly elected class representatives luck as they embark on the journey to represent the grade.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reducing Plastic Use</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2013/11/25/reducing-plastic-use/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Friends Academy environment is a warm and nurturing place.  Students play an important role in reducing plastic use, not only in the school environment, but also in the rest of the world.   Plastic has become such a big part of everyday lives; however, the chemical building blocks that make plastic so versatile may seriously harm the planet.   Many manageable options exist that would avoid the large consumption of plastic given its deleterious effects on the environment.

One such option, proposed just last year by the Environmental Club, is that all students stop using plastic bottles around campus. Signs and other awareness advertisements were posted throughout the school in order to support the Environmental Club's request.   Both students and faculty encouraged one another to switch from plastic bottles to recyclable bottles. Word quickly spread around campus, and the bookstore began to sell recyclable bottles to encourage the Environmental Club's proposal.

This year, the Friends Academy community has made advancements towards the proposed ban of plastic bottles on campus.  For instance, the bookstore no longer sells any non-recyclable bottles, and students cannot carry plastic Poland Spring water bottles in classrooms.  Many teachers also started bringing in recyclable bottles to set a good example for their students.  The Environmental Club is trying to reinforce the plastic ban by reminding the community frequently during Upper School assemblies.

Individuals are responsible for taking an active role in keeping the Friends Academy environment safe and beautiful. A great way to start taking responsibility is to stop plastic bottle use both on and off campus.  Recyclable bottles are readily accessible, affordable, and just as easy to use as plastic bottles.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friends Academy's Varsity Football team had a big victory over Great Neck South under the lights.  The major lead that Friends Academy's Varsity team gained against the opponents gave members on the Junior Varsity squad a chance to play during the game.  The Freshmen and Sophomore teammates proved that the football program has the potential to dramatically improve over the next few years.  Friends Academy's Junior Varsity backup players impressed the crowd with their skill against Great Neck South's older, Varsity football team.  The Cincinnati Bengals versus the New York Jets NFL game on October 27 paralleled Friends Academy's final home game.  The score gap between the two NFL teams became so great that the Cincinnati Bengals placed their backup players in the game to prevent injuries of important team members and to give less noted people an opportunity to showcase their skills. The defeat of the New York Jets is very similar to Great Neck South's defeat during the Senior's last home game.  Both NFL teams and Friends Academy's football squad proved that backups can be of use, even at a high playing level of the sport.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When students entered the theater on Halloween, they were not sure what to expect. However, nobody expected to have so much fun that they would not want to hear the words "Thank you, Seniors first."  Students were entertained by Freshman, Julia Mariani as a Snowflake, amazed by Junior Javana Clark and Sophomore Peter Bahr’s rapping skill<span style="line-height: 1.5;">s, and even hit by lemons thanks to Mrs. Pozzi.</span>

While people love cute costumes, Halloween is meant to be a scary holiday. Grace Covelli spooked the Upper School when she dressed as a headless horsemen, Cade Huesby terrified students and teachers alike in his Walking Dead costume, but perhaps nothing was scarier than Mr. Morris and Liam Bardong doing a duet to “What Does the Fox Say?”  Liam then stole the crowd’s heart when he sang along to Bruno Mars’ “Just the Way You Are” to one lucky lady in the theater. The auditorium literally looked like a zoo when the herd of Junior boys who dressed up as animals took the stage.  Chubaka initially led the herd b<span style="line-height: 1.5;">ut later took quite a big tumble on stage.</span>

The teachers certainly outdid themselves as well. The math department played the cast of Alice and Wonderland and Mr. Helpern dressed as Fantastic Mr. Fox. The Kardashian Klan toppe<span style="line-height: 1.5;">d off the assembly.  Tyrone Perkins did his best Kanye West impression, while getting into a debacle with the Friends Academy authorities. The Kardashians even brought their newest family member, baby North. Overall, the Halloween Assembly was an awesome event that will be talked about for the remainder of the year.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Boys Varsity Soccer team arrived to Middletown, New York on Friday unsure of the future and came home Sunday night with the 2013 New York State Class C Championship title. The team ended their year with a 15-1-2 record. In the Semi-Finals on Saturday, under the lights, Friends Academy played against Lake George.  The combination of Jonny Nierenberg, Harrison Seideman, and Max Heffron all scoring and goalkeeper Brandon Rosenbaum saving five shots led Friends Academy to their first victory in the tournament. Boys Varsity Soccer then advanced to the Finals to play against Lansing. From the minute the game started, Lansing double teamed All-State player, Jonny Nierenberg. However, other Friends Academy teammates organized plays, which created opportunities to score goals. The score at the end of the first half was 0-0. While the team could have given up and felt dejected, the boys pushed on. In the 60th minute of play, Pat Moodhe threw the ball in, and Jonny Nierenberg headed the ball into the net, scoring the first and only goal of the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both teams vigorously fought for the State title, but the Quakers fought harder and became champions. Sadly, this dream team is graduating seven seniors this year, but with many skilled juniors and underclassmen, Friends Academy hopes for a strong performance next year. Congratulations boys on an amazing season!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost all of the leaves have deserted the trees. The small, cherry-colored fruits, which have a name that remains uncertain to the majority of Friends Academy students, are sprawled artfully over the campus grounds and continue to be smashed into the pavement.  <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">A chill is in the air as students rush to class anxiously, ready to tackle last-minute tests, and trying to mentally cram material. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Thanksgiving approached quickly and the whole school is excited for a sweet week off. Thanksgiving is many students' favorite holiday because of "the opportunity to spend time with family and just enjoy life," said Perry Gordon with a smile. "This break gives me a little time to breathe, and I'm just excited that there is no school" he adds. This mid-November rest is a much-deserved break, especially for the Juniors and Seniors, who currently have plenty of work on their plates. Personally I cannot wait to replace my worries with some delicious turkey!</span>

The Junior class went to Washington DC bright and early this past Sunday and will return just in time for the holiday. Junior, Juliane Florez, is heading to Florida to spend Thanksgiving with her club field hockey team. When asked how she feels about celebrating without her family this year, Juliane said (about her team), "They are my other family! I think on Thanksgiving it is important to be with people that you care about."

Eight Friends Academy students all agreed that mashed potatoes are their favorite Thanksgiving food. Luckily, mashed potatoes are not hard to find on Turkey Day. Who needs to be with family when you have mashed potatoes anyway?

T<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">his Thanksgiving, remind yourself what you are truly thankful for, (other than a 5-day break). </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Have a wonderful holiday!</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The winter concert was a great way to kick off the holiday season. December was a time full of joy and excitement. This year's concert was exceptionally special and generated a lot of buzz from the Friends Academy community.  Mr. Tennyson and Mr. Romano led the wind ensemble in the first song of the evening, “Pink Lemonade.” Next, Mrs. Regelmann, accompanied on the piano by Mrs. Maury, led the concert choir.  The choir girls walk through the audience during the song “Singing In The Rain” was a highlight of the night and greatly involved the audience. The chamber choir gave a beautiful rendition of the Godspell classic “All For The Best.” The orchestra, conducted by Mr. Liverani, followed the chamber choir and played the classic song, “Concerto Polonois”.  Then, Mr. Liverani skillfully led the symphony in “Procession of the Sardar.” The finale was a true treat as the audience participated in the performance of the “Hallelujah Chorus” from Handel’s Messiah. Overall the winter concert was a huge success and all musicians that were involved should be proud of their performances.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A beautiful, edgy book that should be a must-read for all high school students, "The Fault in Our Stars" by John Green, taps into deep emotions.  This book can be categorized under any genre. It is a splendid mix of humor, romance, adventure, suspense, and tragedy.

The life of Hazel Grace, who has terminal cancer, has always been an endless battle for survival.  The pleasant arrival of Augustus Waters, who survives cancer when doctors amputate his leg, brings Hazel Grace comfort, strength, and most importantly, the joyous experience of falling in love. Readers become hopelessly attached to the book's unique and enticing characters.

An amazing aspect of the book is how the author, John Green, makes the reader nearly forget that Augustus only has one leg, and Hazel must carry an oxygen tank everywhere she goes with him.

The book knocks readers out of their chairs when an incredibly tragic problem occurs that will ultimately leave tear drops staining the remaining pages of the book.

"The Fault in Our Stars" is considered a masterpiece by the toughest of critics and deserves a place on everyone's bookshelf.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Student TED Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="line-height: 1.5;">[gallery link="file"]

</span>

On Monday and Wednesday, a handful of 11th grade students shared extremely thought-provoking presentations referred to as “TED talks” during assembly blocks. Both Noah Brox and Arman Salem participate in the Independent Studies course at Friends Academy. Even the name of the class implies that the course entails rigorous independent work. Another student, Casey Rosen, shared her research with the Junior and Freshman classes regarding the anxiety levels of high school students. Inkwell's reporters interviewed some Juniors this week about their feelings towards the class, their projects, and the TED talks.

The Independent Studies Course offers students the opportunity to delve into topics that they are really interested in and to become experts in that area. While many students recommend this class, none deny that the class is difficult. Noah Brox, who created his own pair of headphones from scratch, spent many long nights wrestling with spare parts.  Noah constructed and designed the headphones out of wood, wire, and a great deal of hard work.  Throughout the process there were times when Noah desperately wanted to give up, but looking back he could not be happier that he stuck with the tedious project and finished with a product that is so detailed it could be store bought. Noah said, “ I am proud of myself and the result because I know it was worth the effort. I started off believing I could never do it, so it's a great feeling now.”

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">There is a large amount of time and work put into these extensive projects.  When asked how he felt about the presenting part and he answered, “Presenting to the whole school seems </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">intimidating right before, but if you're proud of what you've done and know you've put the effort in, you are good to go.” And that is exactly what he did. Even without note cards to read, Noah did not seem uncomfortable while speaking to the audience. It is common to have some form of anxiety, especially if one is stressed at the same time. Either in a social or academic environment, it is important to think positive thoughts or hyper-focus if feeling stuck because anxiety can be a real set-back. As anxiety becomes more prominent in students with increasing pressure and difficulty of work, sometimes students forget that small things can help. Nervousness is completely normal, and taking deep breaths or accepting the feeling is the only way to cope. To students that become nervous about being in front of an audience, Noah advises, “Know that you're up there for a reason, and that you're capable of doing it.”  These stories highlight that the Independent Studies Couth class is not only an extensive research project but also a worthwhile learning experience.</span>

Arman Salem presented the math and physics found in specific aspects of sports. The presentation's focus on football caught the audience’s attention. Everyone was really intrigued and engaged.  Arman says that his first few project ideas were turned down for various reasons. It was not until he and Noah began discussing an ESPN Sports Science video that Noah suggested the idea of creating a project along the lines of sports. Arman skillfully used this ESPN Science video as an inspiration to create his own unique and scientific sports related video. On the matter of whether Arman was nervous before the presentation, he claims, “I was pretty nervous leading up to the presentation and the night before but once I went up on stage there was nothing else I could do at that point to change the presentation or make it better so I calmed myself down right before I went up and just went through with the presentation.” Arman is sharing very good advice: the only thing a person can do is his or her best and be confident.

Noah and Arman both encourage and recommend taking the Independent Studies course.  Students who like a class that “gives much more freedom than your average science class" and allows students "to work on things that they are interested in and choose" should definitely consider this beneficial class.]]></content:encoded>

This past February break, the new Global Studies Program took 6 kids on a service trip to El Salvador. The trip slightly differed from past trips, as it took on a new persona with the Global Studies class. Alexis Toles ('15), Maggie Brennan ('14), Andrew Stingi ('14), Gabe Patino ('15), Arman Salem ('15), and I had the most inspiring and eye opening experiences of our lives thus far. We broke out of the Friends Academy "bubble," and experienced poverty on a level we had only seen in pictures. The issue was made tangible when we traveled in the country, interacted with the people, and built relationships with families that actually live in these difficult conditions.   Maggie Brennan stated, "I couldn't imagine my last February break at FA with a greater group of people in a greater country."  All six of us students as well as the chaperones, Ms. Reed, Ms. Lai, Ms. Martin, and Teacher John, returned home to New York with a new understanding of the world in our hearts.

The first half of the trip consisted of activities relating to the Alternatives to Violence Project (AVP) with the locals and with Teacher John as a facilitator. Our group also helped out in an art center where the leader, Sister Peggy McGlinchey is actually the sister of former Lower School teacher Ellie McGlinchey.  In the next town, we alternated between teaching English to children and building a latrine for a very welcoming family. Andrew Stingi( aka Andrés Aventuroso) said, "I miss my nugget Alejandra."  We could not have asked for a better experience, and truly appreciate the work the Global Studies Committee did to support this trip to El Salvador.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Knitwear</b>

Knitwear has always been in, but this season knitwear is not just sweaters and socks but also dresses, pants, and even knit jump suits! We all love comfy knit sweaters to keep us warm on a breezy day, so why not try to incorporate a new knit dress into your wardrobe?

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-3611" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1031183_fpx.tif-246x300.jpeg" alt="1031183_fpx.tif" width="246" height="300" /><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3612" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/olive-knit-sweater-02-225x300.jpg" alt="olive-knit-sweater-02" width="176" height="235" /><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3613" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/oversized-cable-knitted-sweaters-fancy-oversize-wine-red-sweaters-high-neck-cable-knitted-sweater-fo-f19775-200x300.jpg" alt="oversized cable knitted sweaters fancy oversize wine red sweaters high neck cable knitted sweater fo-f19775" width="199" height="300" />

<b>Fur</b>

Fur doesn't just keep you warm but adds personality to a dull outfit. If you are one of those people who is not pro-fur for reasons that have to do with animals then try faux fur! It's a great way to keep the stylish aspect of fur while still not wearing a real animal’s fur.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3565" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fur-vest-206x300.jpg" alt="fur-vest" width="206" height="300" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3572" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/OLSENSANONYMOUSBLOGMKAMARYKATEANDASHLEYOLSENFASHIONSTYLEBLOGFURVESTCOATREDLIPSDENIMHEREMESBAGGOLDSNAKECLUTCHEMERALDGOLDRING-191x300.png" alt="OLSENSANONYMOUSBLOGMKAMARYKATEANDASHLEYOLSENFASHIONSTYLEBLOGFURVESTCOATREDLIPSDENIMHEREMESBAGGOLDSNAKECLUTCHEMERALDGOLDRING" width="191" height="300" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3579" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fur_vest21-197x300.jpg" alt="fur_vest2" width="197" height="300" />

&nbsp;

<b>Slip on sneakers </b>

They’re back!! Slip on sneakers were popular during the 80’s and 90’s and they made a come back last spring. The slip-on sneaker is the hottest shoe style right now. It’s not just a cool look but its comfortable too! I definitely recommend buying a pair of slip-on sneakers this fall.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-3574" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thetallnshort-slip-on-sneakers-trainers-celine-givenchy-topshop-steve-madden-zara-leotard-snake-print-pony-leather-lace-spring-2014-4-300x198.jpg" alt="thetallnshort-slip-on-sneakers-trainers-celine-givenchy-topshop-steve-madden-zara-leotard-snake-print-pony-leather-lace-spring-2014 (4)" width="280" height="185" /><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3570" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/img-thing.jpeg" alt="img-thing" width="185" height="185" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3566" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_4359-300x199.jpg" alt="IMG_4359" width="300" height="199" />

&nbsp;

<b>Camouflage </b>

Camo is an "in" trend right now for the fall into winter. If you think about it, it’s a little weird that camouflage is an item of clothing people wear, considering it represents soldiers and soldiers fight in wars. Does that been we are supporting war? Just something to think about, especially at a Quaker school. Still a stylish look for the weekend, though!

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-3567" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/img-thing-1.jpeg" alt="img-thing-1" width="222" height="222" /><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3560" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls_-225x300.jpeg" alt="dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls" width="166" height="221" /><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/img-thing-21.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3588" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/img-thing-21.jpeg" alt="img-thing-2" width="232" height="232" /></a>

&nbsp;

<b>Zippers </b>

One of the most chic looks right now is zippers! Lots and lots of zippers! Zippers on tee shirts, sweaters, pants, gloves, dresses, any article of clothing. Zippers are no longer just something to zip up your dress but a fashionable way to wear clothing.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3559" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/B1264_BL7190_m-300x300.jpeg" alt="B1264_BL7190_m" width="300" height="300" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3583" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/images.jpeg" alt="images" width="183" height="275" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3569" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/img-thing-3.jpeg" alt="img-thing-3" width="300" height="300" />

&nbsp;

<b>Fingerless gloves</b>

Fingerless gloves give your hand warmth while also giving off an edgy persona. It’s cool to match with skinny jeans, sweaters--really anything. Fingerless gloves will always be in style. It’s such an easy piece to throw on with any outfit!

&nbsp;

That's all for this week!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Sitting in silence for 35 minutes every Thursday is livelier than one would expect...</strong>

1. If you walk in late…

<img class="alignleft" src="http://media.thedailytouch.com/2013/09/thats-unacceptable.gif" alt="" width="500" height="279" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

2. You sit next to a kid who forgot deodorant this morning

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-19006-1411678183-6.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3698" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-19006-1411678183-6.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-19006-1411678183-6" width="245" height="245" /></a>

3. You make awkward eye contact

<img class="alignnone wp-image-3700 " src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-buzz-30420-1411948489-4.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-buzz-30420-1411948489-4" width="501" height="283" />

4. You fight the inner battle to stay awake

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-19295-1408402705-1.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3701 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-19295-1408402705-1.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-19295-1408402705-1" width="500" height="282" /></a>

5. Your stomach grumbles

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-2834-1410809443-28.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3721 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-2834-1410809443-28.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-2834-1410809443-28" width="500" height="282" /></a>

&nbsp;

6. You tried, but sadly failed to hide your stomach grumbles

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-13619-1412007784-5.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3704 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-13619-1412007784-5.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-13619-1412007784-5" width="500" height="327" /></a>

7. You really have to cough, but you don't want to draw attention to yourself

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-1782-1410320604-2.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3705 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-1782-1410320604-2.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-1782-1410320604-2" width="500" height="280" /></a>

8. You're blessed with the occasional Gospel Choir performance *start jamming to the song you can't get out of your head*

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-19776-1411668979-1.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3706 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-19776-1411668979-1.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-19776-1411668979-1" width="500" height="266" /></a>

9. You try not to laugh at a funny joke

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-29963-1410558003-12.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3707 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-29963-1410558003-12.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-29963-1410558003-12" width="400" height="300" /></a>

10. ...You end up laughing and a teacher catches you …

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-16917-1410808225-9.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3710 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-16917-1410808225-9.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-16917-1410808225-9" width="500" height="280" /></a>

11. And again, you have to fight off the urge to nap...

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-14126-1411934892-15.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3711 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-14126-1411934892-15.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-14126-1411934892-15" width="500" height="287" /></a>

12. Someone stands up and everyone whips their heads

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-29793-1408735901-1.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-3745 alignleft" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-29793-1408735901-1.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-29793-1408735901-1" width="500" height="189" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

13. You listen to Mr. Lape talk about his dancing days

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tumblr_mf5bl2Pw3m1rz0x9z.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3738 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tumblr_mf5bl2Pw3m1rz0x9z.gif" alt="tumblr_mf5bl2Pw3m1rz0x9z" width="400" height="183" /></a>

14.  A senior gets up and talks about time and to enjoy yourself at FA while you can. (cue meme of rolling eyes)

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-32756-1411755894-1.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3716 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-32756-1411755894-1.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-32756-1411755894-1" width="400" height="225" /></a>

15. You start enjoying the silence

<img class="alignnone wp-image-3715 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-12648-1411677386-1.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-12648-1411677386-1" width="500" height="282" />

16. Finally, you find your inner light

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-12494-1410664148-4.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3718 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-12494-1410664148-4.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-12494-1410664148-4" width="500" height="265" /></a>

17. Tasque clerks shaking hands is basically…

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-19852-1410402186-5_preview.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3719 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-19852-1410402186-5_preview.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-19852-1410402186-5_preview" width="500" height="343" /></a>

18. Walking back and knowing there are bagels waiting in advisory

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-31165-1411698795-1.gif"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3720 size-full" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/anigif_enhanced-31165-1411698795-1.gif" alt="anigif_enhanced-31165-1411698795-1" width="500" height="240" /></a>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[FA Sports:

This past Saturday, the Friends Academy Quakers lost in a shootout against Island Trees. A shout out has to go out to Senior, Cyrus Holder, for scoring 5 touchdowns (4 receiving and 1 kickoff) and tallying more than 300 total all purpose yards. He leads all of Long Island in receiving touchdowns with 7. Junior Quarterback, Corey Goldglit is 3<sup>rd</sup> on Long Island in Passing Touchdowns with 9.

&nbsp;

Boys Varsity Soccer scored two goals against Oyster Bay to win this past Monday. Goals go to Gabe Patino and Merek Glover.

&nbsp;

Professional Sports:

This past Sunday, the 0-3 Tampa Bay Buccaneers shocked everybody by pulling off a last second score to win the game 27-24. Mike Glennon hit star receiver Vincent Jackson for a 5 yard touchdown pass to astonish the Steelers and grab their first win of the season. Also of note is that the Kansas City Chiefs smacked the New England Patriots, 41-14, on Monday Night Football. Chiefs runningback, Knile Davis, ran for 107 yards and the defense intercepted Tom Brady twice. Nobody could have seen this coming.

&nbsp;

In the MLB, the playoffs begin to take form as the Kansas City Royals, San Francisco Giants, and Pittsburgh Pirates all punched their tickets to the Postseason, yet they were an afterthought as everyone knew what the big talk of the town this week in sports.

&nbsp;

New York Yankees shortstop, Derek Jeter, finished an amazing career this week by doing it the only way he knows how. In the bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup> Jeter drove in the winning run to defeat the Baltimore Orioles in dramatic fashion and then celebrated with teammates of the present and past. The crowd chanted his name one last time as he tipped his cap. What an amazing way to end an amazing run. Thank you Derek, you will be missed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a new student at Friends Academy, or any school for that matter, you must always wonder what people are thinking of you--but not so much the other way around! Want to hear the perspective of a new classmate? As a new student myself, I'm here to share!
First, a brief history of my education so far. I was exposed to the whole private school routine until I was in the third grade, when I began to attend above-average public schools. Coming straight out of a public school, one of the first things I noticed about Friends Academy was the general virtuosity in all aspects of the school. I'm serious! From the teachers and the way they really seem to care about your success, to the engaging and stimulating academics, the stellar athletic facilities, incredible college advisers, great food, and even desks that swivel! (I happen to find them fun.)

Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention the seemingly nice student body. (I only say "seemingly" because I have been here for less than 3 weeks!)

Let's begin with the teachers. It is common knowledge that at schools like Friends Academy you are geared towards success, and the only way you are going to get there is with guidance of teachers who not only know their stuff but care about YOU. They want you to succeed. I have been amazed by how involved and prepared the teachers are, even when their classes seem to resemble pandemonium! The teachers' attention to detail and their affection for their students' individual success is clear to see.

Like the teachers, the college counselors express a sentiment that they will fight and work for you to guide you on your path to achieve your specific goals. This is exemplified by a quote by Ed Dugger -- "I dont think only two years ahead, i think about eight years ahead" -- when speaking on the subject of life after Friends Academy and college.

Another thing Friends Academy features is its stimulating classroom environment. Coming from a school where the teacher to student ratio is 1:24, the 1:8 ratio here really allows for a more personal learning experience. Instead of feeling like one amongst a crowd, you feel engaged and vital to the function of the class.

The athletic environment mirrors the educational environment. The feeling that your sport is important pushes you towards improvement, much like in the classroom setting. Having state-of-the-art facilities that are very well maintained is not bad either.

I am proud to be a part of Friends Academy, and I can really say this is the nicest environment for education I have ever experienced.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to Inkwell 2.0!  This year we are launching with an entirely new website created by Editor in Chief Kyle Rosenbluth and a brand new editorial staff. Our primary goal for this year is to build up our readership. Thus, we plan to diverge from the run-of-the-mill articles that characterized past editions of our school newspaper.  Inkwell 2.0 will feature more multimedia content than ever before: videos, quizzes, comedy skits (courtesy of class clown Perry Gordon), movie and music reviews,  and social media updates (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) provided by senior correspondent Bel Evans. This year we hope to develop a regular readership through providing the Friends community with a revamped Inkwell that will grab the your attention and keep you coming back week after week.

Thanks for reading!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Inkwell Staff- I am pleased with your invigorated approach to this publication. I hope that readership increases. I do hope that there will continue to be well researched, informed articles that speak to specific school concerns. The work that Brittany Kriegstein did on Cheating at FA has provided the school a launching pad for multiple initiatives. I hope that the new version of Inkwell does not become the "Ink-quirer".]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Death by Cafeteria Food, Or Lack Thereof! </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Word on the street is: the new cafeteria has been met with opposition, and for good reason. None of the so-called “improvements” have made the students’ dining experience better. Now, all students are required to be on meal plan, meaning that even if they bring in their own food they are still paying an exorbitant amount of money for one sub-par meal at FA. The school has seemingly tried to make it so that we, as students, eat less. They removed trays so that we can't get as much food as we want and are limited to what we can hold in our hands. The cafeteria serves plain pasta multiple times a week, and when asked what meat is in the meal, they say “there is bacon in the pasta sauce.” According to some, the cafeteria also doesn't serve students as much food as they want. The school seems to want to discourage students from getting seconds, hoping that kids won’t have the motivation to go back through the horrendously long lines. The system is taking advantage of the students and promoting malnourishment. How are we, as growing and developing young people, supposed to make it through an entire school day and sports with one tiny serving of plain pasta?  We are not getting enough healthy grains or protein in our diet. We are not getting served what we deserve!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would urge the writer to please speak with Jodi Resnick, the food service manager, to clear up what seems to be some misunderstandings. Students are not limited to the amount of food they eat each day at lunch. Students may ask for seconds! or Thirds! Please- eat what you take and don't waste! The morning snack is opening until 10:30am every day. It closes at 10:30am to allow for the staff to set up for Lower and Middle School lunch that begins at 10:50am. There is an after school snack program too. No one should go hungry! Student Faculty Board is open to hearing concerns and has brought forward suggestions already! You may notice there are now THREE sandwich lines and FIVE Panini presses! Student voices are important- bring them through SFB.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Cathy, your point is well taken. Thank you for commenting, and for reminding us all of our relative abundance, and of the hard work of our wonderfully kind Food Services colleagues.


I commend Bel for broaching a topic "in print" that is on many FA minds these days. Moreover I predict, because I know her to be an excellent writer and an unusually thoughtful person, that Bel's next published piece for Inkwell (whether on this topic or another) will be more vigorously reported. 


In the meantime, Inkwell accepts responsibility for the factual errors in the original version of this article and has corrected them. I would advise the editors to take this opportunity to launch a real reporting mission on this story, worthy of the complexities at work: institutional, financial, dietary, personal--a rich accounting of counterarguments and perspectives. Good journalism, in other words! Take up the gauntlet!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>A Different Perspective: FA Food Service</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2014/10/10/facts-about-food-service/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>This article is a guest post written by <strong>Jodi Resnick (Director of Food Services) and Ann Marie Tidona (Director of Finance).</strong></strong>

The food service at Friends Academy features the highest quality meats and cheeses. Milk is hormone-free, and fruits and vegetables are all fresh and locally sourced when possible. Protein, grains, and vegetarian options are provided daily, and the food service director works closely with families of students with allergies. Additionally, gluten-free options are available daily. The program underwent a rigorous review two years ago, and the current service provider was selected through a lengthy process which included a team of administrators, field trips, and a competitive bid process. As a result of that process, we can be assured the quality is present and the costs are well in line with industry standards.

Trays were eliminated for 2014-15 in order to accommodate the lower school family dining and not to limit the quantity of food available to students. It was the hope that this change would reduce the amount of food waste as students would no longer be forced to fill their trays in case they were still hungry as in the past students could only go through the food line once. Currently, students can return for seconds as often as
they like. In fact, we as a community are consuming considerably more food per person than we have in the past and at an average higher than in other independent schools (of which there are many) that Flik serves.

The food lines have been and remain a concern given the number of students who arrive at the same time. The wait time is typically 5 minutes or less. A third deli line and additional panini makers were implemented on October 1st, and these changes have significantly reduced the lines.

At the request of the coaches, pasta (including gluten-free) is available to students on a more frequent basis and is never served plain unless requested. There are always choices of sauces for the pasta.

The school has employed health and wellness initiatives such as eliminating pizza and cookies every day. Instead, fresh fruit, both whole and cut up, are provided daily.]]></content:encoded>

Black clothing with studs achieves the edgy look. Add chunky jewelry and a leather jacket and you're good to go!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As Oscar season approaches, you'll be more and more motivated to get off the couch and go to your local multiplex. Here are the five movies I am most anticipating for the fall season:

&nbsp;

<strong>Birdman:</strong>

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/124334_gal.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3842 alignleft" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/124334_gal.jpg" alt="124334_gal" width="405" height="600" /></a>

&nbsp;

A film many are claiming could mark Michael Keaton's comeback to serious, high quality cinema, <em>Birdman</em> looks to develop the superhero movie into something more psychologically grounded yet still explosive. Keaton is supported by a stellar list of actors: Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton and Emma Stone, to name a few. With already glowing reviews from the few critics who have had a chance to preview the film, <em>Birdman</em> is sure to make a splash when it comes out on October 17th. <strong>Trailer: </strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc</a>

<strong>Nightcrawler:</strong>

<em>Nightcrawler</em>, the latest film by director Dan Gilroy, stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a novice independent crime reporter more concerned with getting the story than with journalistic ethics. Judging from the trailer, <em>Nightcrawler</em> has a dark, thrilling undertone, and it is good to see Gyllenhaal reprising a role more akin to his days in the films <em>Zodiac</em> and <em>Donnie Darko</em>. Coming to theaters October 31st. <strong>Trailer:</strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1uP_8VJkDQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1uP_8VJkDQ</a>

&nbsp;

<strong>Interstellar:</strong>

<em>Interstellar</em> is Christopher Nolan's latest and much anticipated project, announced almost more than a year ago. <em>Interstellar</em> tells the story of an astronaut (Matthew McConaughey) making a last-ditch effort to save humanity from its own self destructive tendencies. <em>Interstellar</em> looks quite similar to the 1997 sci-fi film <em>Contact</em> (based on a book of the same title by the famed astronomer Carl Sagan) which also featured McConaughey in a lead role. Where <em>Interstellar</em> seems to differ, however, is in Nolan's focus on the human angle. Coming to theaters November 7th. <strong>Trailer: </strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vxOhd4qlnA" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vxOhd4qlnA</a>

&nbsp;

<strong>Foxcatcher:</strong>

<strong><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/120144_gal.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3847 alignleft" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/120144_gal.jpg" alt="120144_gal" width="450" height="600" /></a></strong>

When <em>Foxcatcher</em> debuted at the Cannes film festival, two reactions were heard. First, critics were instantly naming this their pick for movie of the year. Second, critics were thrilled by Steve Carrell's fantastic acting chops in a serious role. And <em>Foxcatcher</em> is in fact Carrell's first serious role in, well, forever. That alone makes it worth seeing. The movie is based on a true story and focuses on the relationship between a boxer and his coach. Foxcatcher comes to theaters just one week. <strong>Trailer: </strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PypvNBTdxnY" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PypvNBTdxnY</a>

<strong>Inherent Vice:</strong>

I saved my personal favorite for last. <em>Inherent Vice</em>, an adaptation of the eponymous book by Thomas Pynchon, is the work of director Paul Thomas Anderson (famed for films including <em>There Will Be Blood</em> and <em>Magnolia</em>) starring Joaquin Phoenix. The trailer for this film came out just a few weeks ago and it looks fantastic. The narration is done by famous indie harpist Joanna Newsom, and the score is composed and performed by Radiohead lead Jonny Greenwood. <em>Inherent Vice</em> is Anderson's return to his earlier ensemble movies like <em>Boogie Nights</em> and <em>Magnolia</em> with its sprawling cast (Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Martin Short, Reese Witherspoon, and countless more). <em>Inherent Vice</em> comes to theaters December 14th, or as Newsom states at the end of the trailer in her iconic, quirky voice, "Just in time for Christmas." You'd be remiss if you didn't check this one out. <strong>Trailer: </strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUZgOQ186-A" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUZgOQ186-A</a>

Those are the 5 movies that I am most looking forward to this fall. Agree? Disagree? Let me know your thoughts in the comments!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Where The Wild Things Are</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/500wildthings.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3885" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/500wildthings-300x225.jpg" alt="500wildthings" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Making an appearance in 2008, these four friends dressed up as the monsters from Maurice Sendak's book, "Where The Wild Things Are".  The heads are made of paper mache, while the eyes glow in the dark, creating the full monster effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mask of Emotion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/550emoticon.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3887" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/550emoticon-300x267.jpg" alt="550emoticon" width="300" height="267" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This helmet, otherwise known as the Mask of Emotion, was created by Digital Media Design Department at Hongik University in Korea. Although the helmet hides your face, it displays "emoticons" that are based on the wearer's body actions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jack Skellington</strong>
<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/565skellington11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3923" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/565skellington11-300x284.jpg" alt="565skellington[1]" width="300" height="284" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This Halloween costume was created by an artist who made the suit herself. The suit then fit over the stilts this "character" walked on.  Jack Skellington's head was built over a helmet to ensure its stability; however, this was not the best design for visibility!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mousetrap</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/508mousetrap1.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3929" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/508mousetrap1-300x256.png" alt="508mousetrap[1]" width="300" height="256" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This costume was created by Jeff, a father from Ohio, who made the mousetrap for his 3-year-old daughter for Halloween.  The trap was basically devised as an excuse to let the parents off the hook from walking house to house: when his daughter refused to cooperate with their plan of avoiding trick or treating, Jeff compromised by incorporating her costume onto a wagon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rollercoaster Riders</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/enhanced-buzz-6401-1409806845-71.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3941" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/enhanced-buzz-6401-1409806845-71-300x241.jpg" alt="enhanced-buzz-6401-1409806845-7[1]" width="300" height="241" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This fantastic Halloween costume is a great one to rock with all your friends.  Each person can make their own seat and legs, making everyone's look different, and add their own personal twist for each "rider".  Whether it's a big or small group, this Halloween costume is perfect for any group at any age!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Baby Burrito</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/enhanced-buzz-7749-1382044048-211.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3950" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/enhanced-buzz-7749-1382044048-211-300x200.jpg" alt="enhanced-buzz-7749-1382044048-21[1]" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The parents of this young baby had an obsession with the Mexican restaurant "Chipotle", so for Halloween they decided to dress their baby up as their favorite meal there: a burrito.  Having made the entire costume themselves, the parents and their picture soon became an internet sensation worldwide!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lego Couple</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/l_d09b3e80-dc8b-11e1-9ba0-9986b5b000061.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3953" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/l_d09b3e80-dc8b-11e1-9ba0-9986b5b000061-225x300.jpg" alt="l_d09b3e80-dc8b-11e1-9ba0-9986b5b00006[1]" width="225" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This married couple created their own homemade lego costume for Halloween a few years ago.  This costume was a huge success, becoming a popular hit not only on the internet, but also in mainstream trick-or-treating.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ken and Barbie </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ken-and-Barbie-350x3501.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3954" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ken-and-Barbie-350x3501-300x300.jpg" alt="Ken-and-Barbie-350x350[1]" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This young couple took their costumes back to their childhood when Barbie dolls were the biggest hit around!  Making the doll boxes themselves and buying fancy clothes that resemble Barbie and Ken, these two are the perfect couple to rock this stunning and creative costume!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Obama Poster</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Amazing-Obama-Hope-Halloween-Costume1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3956" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Amazing-Obama-Hope-Halloween-Costume1-225x300.jpg" alt="Amazing-Obama-Hope-Halloween-Costume[1]" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Showing his true democratic side, this man represented another popular Halloween concept: politics.  For the past few years, many have dressed up as their favorite political characters, expressing their true beliefs and political sides.  This homemade costume is easy, yet makes a big statement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Simpson's</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/deguisement-simpsons-halloween1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3967" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/deguisement-simpsons-halloween1-224x300.jpg" alt="deguisement-simpsons-halloween[1]" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> This family of four dressed up as Homer, Bart, Marge, and Lisa from the classic television show, "The Simpsons".  Each member painted their face yellow and wore yellow turtlenecks under their outfits, making them look truly yellow and creating the real Simpsons effect.  This costume was overall creative and simple!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sleep deprivation--and its effects, particularly on teens--has become a crucial area of research in the medical field. Sleep deprivation is the condition of not having enough sleep, which can be either acute or chronic. The majority of high school students are, to varying extents, affected by sleep deprivation.

On average, teens need about nine hours of sleep a night to best function, a fact that has been confirmed in <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/teens-health/art-20046157?pg=1" target="_blank">studies conducted by the Mayo Clinic</a>. While sleep deprivation may not seem like a big deal, in reality it can be quite detrimental. Sleep deprivation can lead to difficulty concentrating, learning, and staying awake in class. It can also be a contributing factor in behavioral problems. <a href="http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=873" target="_blank">Studies </a>have drawn direct connections between sleep deprivation and lower grades, moodiness, and depression. The consequences for driving while drowsy can be serious, especially with teen drivers. <a href="http://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/FINAL%20SOF%202004.pdf" target="_blank">A 2004 study</a> showed that from infancy to fifth grade the majority of students failed to get even the lowest recommended range of sleep. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/health/23brod.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Another study</a> referenced in the <em>New York Times</em> showed that the average eighth grader sleeps less than eight hours a night, and over a quarter of high school and college students are chronically sleep deprived. <a href="http://news.nurse.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080407/NY01/80404015#.VH42nvnF-So" target="_blank">Researchers from Columbia University School of Nursing estimate</a> that 15 million children in America are suffering from sleep deprivation.

In a survey of roughly 200 hundred students in the Upper School At Friends Academy,  89% of students reported that they get, on average, less than 8 hours of sleep a night. Shockingly, 27% of the students admitted to getting under 6 hours of sleep. Though parents and even researchers often assume that students spend a lot of time procrastinating their homework, this idea fails to correlate with the data at Friends. Only 3% of students admitted to spending more than two hours on social media a night. The majority of students spend less than an hour on social media per evening. A possible contributing factor to our national sleep deprivation crisis could be the following: 24% of Friends students reported spending more than four hours on homework a night. A striking 50% admitted to spending three to four hours a night on homework. And 85% of students reported that commitment to after school activities limits their time to get work done.

Clearly, sleep deprivation is a problem in our community, and it needs to be addressed.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Looking Back on Spirit Week 2014</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">A few short weeks ago, the FA Upper School student body was infused with a massive dose of spirit. In what junior Jack Deutsch dubbed as “the most wonderful time of the year,” students from all grades donned their finest costumes for Spirit Week, honoring the Homecoming weekend and the 50th annual Fall Fair. The 2014 spirit week began on a Tuesday with Decades Day, followed with Advisory Day, then Color Day, and then on Friday, Red &amp; Black Day for the pep rally. We spoke with faculty and students to see why spirit week is so near and dear to FA’s heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many enjoy Spirit Week as a time for self-expression. The class of 2015’s Grace Covelli exemplifies the creative energy and freedom of Spirit Week in each of her meticulously assembled outfits. We spoke with Grace on Color Day, when she was quite literally blue from head to toe. With her blue mohawk wig, Covelli was “making the most of it” since her old school did not have a Spirit Week.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Spirit Week presents us with a fun change of pace from FA’s regular dress code. Many agree that the chance to dress up festively is not only exciting because it gives us a break from button-downs, but also because it reveals different aspects of students’ personalities. Senior Michael Kliger boiled spirit week down to one word: “diversity.” Michael enjoys from “seeing the different and interesting sides of people” that surface during spirit week because “everybody is in their most excited mode.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Spirit Week also provides us with a chance to indulge our eccentricities. It offers a chance for everyone – even faculty – to “take on an alter-ego.” Ms. Levy expressed excitement on Decades Day, saying, “If I could have chosen to be raised in one decade, it would have been the '60s,”. One sophomore commented, “It was cool to see my classmates combine their love of music and their spirit in their advisory’s collective ‘phases of Miley Cyrus’ costume.” Pierce Della Ferra tagged advisory day as “a fun time,” providing him with the opportunity to “dress up like something he wouldn't normally”. In Pierce’s case, he strayed outside the realm of everyday reality, decking himself out in short overalls and a cowboy hat. Like those of many students, his costumes and attitude were reflective of Spirit Week excitement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> <a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1900151_679420472153433_82592550183404057_n1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4004" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1900151_679420472153433_82592550183404057_n1.jpg" alt="1900151_679420472153433_82592550183404057_n" width="449" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The seniors set a festive and expressive tone for the school. Jacie O’Brien spoke of this when she said, “This is our grade’s chance to show what we’ve got!” Jacie, who helped create the senior spirit banner, values the togetherness fostered by Spirit Week. She expressed her class’s collective excitement for “finally reaching the top” and the desire to “make the last year an amazing one.” There is something to be said about “reaching the top”-- many members of the Class of 2015 have been at FA for the majority of their educational careers. Another senior spoke of how “the school is unparalleled. FA is such a warm and vibrant community.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This devotion to our school community was most obvious on Friday at the Pep Rally. Athletes proudly displayed their jerseys and everyone else sported their finest red and black. With grades K-12 cheering on our sports teams and welcoming Adam Hartog and Javana Clark as the Homecoming King and Queen, Quaker pride was booming. King Hartog announced that “By the looks of Spirit Week, it’s going to be a good year.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Heisman Time: Is college football&#039;s most glorious trophy waning?</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2014/12/02/heisman-time-is-college-footballs-most-glorious-trophy-waning/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the most exclusive and prestigious club in the world? No, it’s not the Silencio in Paris, nor is is CORE in New York City. (To be honest, I’m so out of touch with everything that I had to look up “exclusive clubs” to get those names.) It may be hard to believe, but it’s not Inkwell either. The aforementioned club is, in fact, the Heisman Fraternity.

Since 1935, when the Heisman was first given to Jay Berwanger of the University of Chicago, it has been awarded yearly to “the outstanding college football player whose performance best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity. Winners epitomize great ability combined with diligence, perseverance, and hard work.”

The Heisman is arguably the toughest trophy to win in sports. In the 78 times it has been awarded, it has gone to 77 different players. Only one player has won it twice: former Ohio State running back Archie Griffin won it as both a junior in 1974 and as a senior in 1975. Part of why it is so hard to repeat is because most people win it late in their college careers. Only four people have won the award before their junior seasons. Three sophomores have won the award: Tim Tebow (2007), Sam Bradford (2008), and Mark Ingram (2009). Even fewer freshmen have taken home the hardware: Johnny Manziel (2012) and Jameis Winston (2013). And no "true" freshman has ever won the award: Manziel and Winston captured the trophy as redshirts.

The Heisman is on a higher level than most sports awards. When I asked a fellow student what they thought of when I said “Heisman” they said “I think of honor and elegance.” The Heisman has the ability to inspire a generation. When Johnny Manziel went from being an unknown redshirt freshman out of tiny Tyler, TX to winning the Heisman, he instantly became a media sensation and an inspiration for college football fans around the nation. I myself have nearly been in love with Johnny Football since his "true" freshman season, and plan to name my first son or daughter after him.

Winning the Heisman means that you were, de facto, the best player in college football that season. But it doesn’t translate to NFL success like it used to. In the 40 years since the first Heisman was awarded, just 17 of the winners can be said to have achieved a high degree of success in professional football after college. In this decade, there are only two Heisman winners who have made it to an NFL Pro Bowl: Cam Newton (Auburn, 2010) of the Carolina Panthers, and Robert Griffin III (Baylor, 2011) of the Washington Redskins. None of the seven Heisman winners from 2001-2007 were able to stick with one team, and none of them have had much (if any) NFL success.

The most recent Heisman winners are have only been on one team so far, mainly because they are so young. The older, more veteran players have been all over the place. There aren’t very many NFL cities that haven’t played host to a Heisman winner at some point. As the chart above shows, many Heisman winners have washed out of the league. This leads to a major question: Is winning the Heisman a big deal any more?

The NFL has a rule saying that a player needs to be three years removed from his high school graduation in order to declare himself eligible for the NFL Draft. Because of this, anyone who has a dream of playing professional football plays in college. College football is the feeder system for the NFL, so having success at the NCAA level is the easiest way to turn yourself into a high draft pick, and there is no greater success than winning the Heisman. Winning the Heisman used to come with an expectation of success for the rest of your football life. Recently, however, people have won or nearly won the Heisman and yet have failed to get drafted. Most recently, Collin Klein of Kansas State finished third in voting, and has yet to even be worked out by an NFL team. When he was still in college, people knew he would never have success in the big leagues. Despite this, he nearly won the Heisman. Just because a person does well enough to nearly win the most prestigious trophy in college football does not necessarily mean they will ever play a down in the NFL.

Still, with players such as Florida State’s Jameis Winston and Oregon’s Marcus Mariota both vying for the Heisman this season, the award will once again return to a player who has the potential to be be a good NFL player. Don’t worry, college football fans: the Heisman is still the most glorious award in sports.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There was a minute left in the recent Monday Night Football game between the St. Louis Rams and San Francisco 49ers, and I was pulling my hair out. I had Austin Davis, the Rams quarterback, on my fantasy football team. The person I was playing had the San Francisco defense, and they intercepted a late Davis pass and returned it for a touchdown. My fantasy lead had evaporated. With :43 seconds left in the actual game, my team was down one-and-a-half points. The next drive, Davis reached 200 passing yards for the game, and because of that the 49ers defense lost two fantasy points. The game clock hit triple-zeroes, and I won my matchup. I was beyond relieved. I can say this with absolute confidence: nearly every guy reading this has been in this position before.

Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry. It is estimated that over 40 million people today play it. Almost every single one of my friends plays it, and many of them are in multiple leagues. For those of you that are not clear on what exactly fantasy football is, allow me to explain while keeping it as simple as I can. It all starts with a draft, where you chose the players that will make up your team. The players get points each week based on their real life stats, and they combine to give your team a total score, and if your team outscores the other person’s than you win your matchup. Fantasy football is much bigger than you may think.

In a survey that I sent out to the school, 83 percent of people said that they either play fantasy football, or know someone that does. In a recent demographic released by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, it was estimated that well-over 40 million people play fantasy football. It was also discovered that roughly 18 percent of all teens play fantasy football. Considering there are just under 42 million teenagers in the United States today, it is safe to say that about 7.5 million people between the ages of 13-19 play fantasy football. When I asked people if they knew anyone that plays fantasy football, none of them were able to answer “no.” It is inescapable. But why do we love it so much?

Maybe it is our natural inability to sit still for a long time. When watching NFL teams go head-to-head every Sunday, many people find themselves needing to fiddle around with something else, while also wanting to keep interest in the games. For that, fantasy football is a perfect fit, as it correlates directly to the games in front of you. Maybe it’s the opposite. Rather than being bored just sitting there watching the games, maybe people want a way to be more involved, so they turn to fantasy sports as a way to add another element to their football viewing experience. The reason that seems most likely to me, however, is neither of these. I happen to think the reason that fantasy football is so popular is because it gives normal people the opportunity to run their own team.

Everybody likes the idea of being in control. A job that entails the “wealing-and-dealing” of high profile athletes in exchange for other players is something that appeals to even the most casual fans. As the manager of a fantasy football team, you truly get to live out your fantasy of running a team of your own. You get to go through a draft, sign and release players, and make trades throughout the season. The spirit of competition is also a big part of why it is so entertaining as well.

I am in a fantasy football league with my friends, and I love them to death. Most of the time, I would rather live on the streets than lose to them, and I’m sure they feel the same way. I never like losing, but losing to my friends is one of the worst feeling ever, and you’re lying if you don’t feel the same way. That’s what makes fantasy football so much fun. Nothing feels better than beating your friends, and nothing worse than losing to them. It makes the matchups mean more. If you just played against people that you never talked to, it wouldn’t be as fun. The trash-talking before and after the games make you want to win that much more. It’s what makes so many people play year-after-year.

People are always going to play fantasy football. For all the aforementioned reasons, it is impossible to stay away from. I have been in leagues where people quit, and 2 weeks later they were again in control of their team. It is impossible to stay away from. I understand this makes me sound like an overly obsessed superfan, but in reality it just makes me a normal guy. Fantasy football will never go away. Just try playing it, and you will see.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friends Academy Girls Varsity Tennis takes the win over the Great Neck South Rebels in the Conference II-A Nassau County Championship. Although the Rebels have beaten us twice in the regular season, we beat them in the finals, at Wheatley High School, when it mattered the most with a score of 4-3. Our coach, Brian Baxter, was ecstatic about the win and said he also felt “relieved.” During the season, after we won a match against Wheatley, Baxter stated that one of our team’s goal is: “[to] get better with each match” and that “we’d like to run the tables and make it into the playoffs.” With his coaching and the hard work done by my teammates and I, out goal was achieved. Our team has worked tremendously hard, playing 9 matches in just 12 days due to inclement weather. In the finals, Friends Academy’s single players, Julia Ciardullo, Calista Sha, and Morgan Wilkins, won all of their matches. However, it was Wilkins’ match that tied this victory all together at the end with a score of 6-4 6-2. Wilkins said that she felt that she played her opponent “a lot smarter this time around.” Danielle Kahn, a senior, believed this accomplishment was made possible because of teamwork. She said: "because everyone was doing their part, working hard, and working together, our season and our win in the finals was successful."  The seniors on our team were especially overjoyed because their last season of high school tennis was ultimately a pure victory.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the soccer teams take their final free kick, the football team throws its final touchdown, and the tennis teams hits their final serves, we look forward to a new season starting up. There are plenty of exciting teams to follow during the winter sports session, and this past week I had the opportunity to sit down with one of the athletes playing a winter sport. Jack Deutsch, a junior, will be going into his 2<sup>nd</sup> year of varsity basketball. He played junior varsity as a 9<sup>th</sup> grader and then made the transition to varsity as a 10<sup>th</sup> grader. I spoke with Jack on the upcoming season and what he looks forward to this season.

Q: What are you looking forward to most for this year’s varsity basketball season?

<em>A: One thing I am really looking forward to… is the basketball. When it comes down to it, whether you’re playing something--basketball, football, or lacrosse--it always comes down to how bad you want that victory.</em>

Q: What’s your goal as a team for this season?

<em>A: I think our goal is just to be the best team we can be. It’s all about being the best lacrosse team in the nation.</em>

Q: Very funny, Jack. Are you excited to be going into your second year of Varsity basketball?

<em>A: I’m about as excited as a hare on a sunny day.</em>

Q: What’s it going to be like this year, now that you have a lot more people your own age on the team alongside you? Will this be a different experience for you?

<em>A: Well, I think a great thing about the team is that it brings people together. It’s like blossoming flowers in the spring.</em>

Q: Anything else you would like to say to the people, Jack?

<em>A: Come out and support us this year! We’d really appreciate it!</em>

		<title>Is Cheating on Sleep Cheating Yourself During the Test?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As diligently as students might think they are studying for tests, there are a few vital reasons why grades might not seem to reflect the time spent studying. Online Quizlet flashcard sets and review packets are passed amongst students like precious gold, but students may be forgetting their most effective study tool--sleep.

Limiting sleep is limiting precious time your brain needs to consolidate countless facts and ideas absorbed throughout the day. Are you thinking that you’ve heard this before, but that scoring a certain grade by studying longer is more important than getting enough sleep? Well, did you realize that every hour of sleep lost can affect your testing performance, and in result, your grades? Some students are reluctant to cut their study time short to hit the sack; they think studying until 1am will stick stacks of terms into their brain. The truth is, recent studies have shown that sleeping is more productive than staying up to cram! Sleeping is learning, and shortchanging yourself of sleep inhibits your memory, judgment, problem solving, and learning… all the mental processes you’ll need during the test.

So, put down the flashcards at a reasonable time and turn out the lights, because the more sleep you get, the better you will function during a test. An expert on learning and memory, Benedict Carey, revealed how students can adjust their sleep schedules to enhance their test performance in New York Times article “Want to Ace that Test? Get the Right Kind of Sleep”. Well, in case you haven’t seen it yet, we’re bringing that info straight to you from Inkwell.

Here’s how you can plan your sleep schedule to enhance performance in specific areas.
<ol>
	<li><strong>For Vocabulary Tests</strong> (English or any other language)<strong>:</strong></li>
</ol>
Vocabulary tests require strict memorization and test your retention. Go to bed at your regular time. Don’t cheat yourself out of the first half of the night; this is the richest time of sleep when your brain consolidates new facts and imprints new words in your mind. Without it, your brain will feel fuzzier regarding just basic facts. If you want, get up early to review material.
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Math, Reading Comprehension, and History:</strong></li>
</ol>
If a test is going to test your brain’s ability to comprehend and decipher complex information, you can stay up a touch later until you reviewed as much material as possible, and then get the full dose of dream-rich sleep. While you’re dreaming deeply, your brain goes through a period of REM sleep, a stage when your brain fuses everything you learned that day, which is vital to understanding the material to your best ability.
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>For athletic and musical performance:</strong></li>
</ol>
If you want to hit the basketball court or the right notes during a concert at your best, sleep accordingly. Practice as much as you can the day before and before bed, then go to bed at your normal time or a little later. During the second half of the night, the brain enhances muscle memory and motor skills, imperative for athletic and musical activities. If a point-guard wants to be thinking as sharply and strategically as possible during a game, he should also strategize, the night before, to get enough sleep. With the increased concentration, energy, and memory that sleep grants, he’ll pass better, shoot with more accuracy, and remember plays with ease. Similarly, for a music recital, stay up a little later preparing and sleep in to your normal time in the morning; rather than waking up early to review and missing valuable time the brain spends refining skills in your muscle memory.

<em> </em>

A final tip to prolong your sleepy time: Cut down your <em>screen</em> time! “When you look at vocabulary and look at huge stimulus after that, your brain has to decide which information to store,” says Harvard neuroscientist, Markus Dworak. “Your brain might favor the emotionally stimulating information over the vocabulary.”

We all know the feeling! You just studied algebra formulas for hours and while scrolling through twitter, you’re confronted with the temptation to watch a sloth eat an ice-cream cone while doing the ice-bucket challenge… and then—is that a chimpanzee cuddling with a baby panda? You’re finished, the quadratic formula you just repeated ten times in your head seems to be replaced with a baby panda.

Basically, try not to look at your phone before bed. It’s scientifically proven that just a glance at the lit screen of computer or cellphone automatically decreases production of the sleep-inducing hormone, melatonin, in the brain. So if you’re in bed at the right time but the last thing on your sleep list includes saying goodnight to your Instagram, be aware, your smartphone might steal your sleep! It’s tough, yes, right you reach to turn on a phone alarm, you’re splashed with a gush of text messages like cold water in the eyes. Just keep in mind that minutes spent on your phone or computer before bed will not only delay your bedtime, but over the course of time deprive you hours of precious sleep your brain needs…Which is reflected when your brain is suddenly foggy during a test you spent hours reviewing for. So don’t be cheap with your sleep, or your grades might end up paying the price.

		<title>Life Without The NFL</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s a scary thought, isn’t it? It’s something that seems impossible and very hard to imagine. We have been raised in a world where the NFL is more than a super-power. It is a presence that is in every corner of the nation. Seemingly everybody knows what those three letters mean. N.F.L… National Football League. It is an unbeatable force, an immovable object. And we may be seeing the end of it.

Back in March, Dallas Mavericks (NBA) owner Mark Cuban said that he thinks that the NFL is heading towards the end. He believes that the NFL is getting too big to control. He was alluding to the NFL’s constant attempts to rule the world. The NFL wants football to be the only sport that anyone cares about, and they don’t even try to hide it.

The NFL Draft usually takes place in April, but this past one was from May 8 until May 10. The NFL said that the reason it moved the date was because of a scheduling conflict at Radio City Music Hall, where the draft is every year. That’s where I call their bluff. You’re the NFL. You are by far the biggest and most popular league in professional sports. There are no scheduling conflicts for you. There is <i>absolutely </i>no doubt that if you want a certain venue at a certain time, it’s yours. Not to mention the fact that it is at the <i>same exact place</i> at the <i>same exact time </i>every single year. It’s not like if I came out of the blue and told the people at Radio City that I needed the stage during the Christmas Spectacular. It’s the freaking National Football League scheduling a yearly event that everyone in the country knows is coming.

As if that wasn’t enough proof that the NFL was trying to take over the American sports world, Sports Illustrated recently released an article talking about the NFL’s TV deals in relation to other sports. It talked about how the NFL used to cooperate with Major League Baseball during the World Series and not schedule any games so that the two leagues were not competing for viewers. This year the NFL scheduled multiple games that conflicted with crucial MLB playoff games, including two during the World Series. Not only were the two games during the World Series, they were also in prime time. Not only were they during the World Series and in prime time, but each game also contained at least one team that wasn’t from a baseball market. For example, the Green Bay Packers and the New Orleans Saints are both from cities that don’t have baseball teams, and they both played in prime time during the World Series. By putting those teams in their respective games, the NFL was trying to maximize its viewership. If the NFL put the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs (the two teams playing in the World Series) as two of the prime time matchups, it is safe to say that the majority of people would still watch the football games rather than the baseball games, regardless of the fact that the baseball games were far more significant. By choosing to put two non-baseball markets in the games, they made sure that both of those cities would have their focus on the NFL. If the Yankees were in the World Series and the Jets were on Thursday Night Football, many of the people in New York would watch the Yankees game if they coincided. However, if you were a Saints fan and the World Series was on and the Saints were on Monday Night Football, nearly the entire Louisiana market would be watching football.

The NFL has its sights set on more than just America, however. They want to rule the world. Every year, the NFL plays multiple games in Europe, which is the league trying to grow its vast fanbase overseas. The Jacksonville Jaguars are a team that plays at least one game at London’s Wembley Stadium. Coincidentally, the Jaguars have been the subject of discussion about relocation for several years now. By making them play in London, the NFL is entertaining the thought of whether or not an NFL team can thrive in a foreign market. The NFL wants a team in Europe; there is no doubt about that. They also don’t want to take a team out of America.

The NFL has publically commentated on the idea of adding new franchises. They have made it perfectly clear that if there is to be a team in a new market, in the United States or internationally, it is going to be an expansion team, rather than the relocation destination of a current one. The NFL has 32 teams, meaning that if they add another one in (for argument’s sake) London, than they will have to add a 34th to keep balance. But is there ever going to be too much?

Historically, those things that grow too big to control end in a major collapse. When you think of things of historical significance that fell at some point, whether it be the Chinese Dynasties, the Roman Empire, or the British Empire (just to name a few), they all followed this pattern. Make no mistake about it—we are currently what can be deemed the NFL Empire. The National Football League is by far the most profitable league in the entire world, out-earning Major League Baseball by over $1 billion. Four of the top five most profitable leagues are major North American sports (football, basketball, baseball, and hockey), and the NFL reigns supreme in North America.

		<title>Does Formal Education Obstruct a Child’s Imagination?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“Sometimes education kills creativity, stifles imagination, and destroys curiosity...all in the name of learning.” Ken Robinson said this during his 2006 Ted Talk, in which he speaks about the crisis of schools limiting children’s imaginations. Today education has taken a drastic turn, making students into “test-taking machines”; students are forced to focus on memorization and are not learning to think for themselves. It seems that society is headed into even more memorization, with students taking more AP classes, state examinations, and SAT/ACTS. Frequently, students are being rushed through course material in order to prepare for examinations or achieve the highest grade possible, no matter the cost. This style of schooling fails to focus on the creative aspect of being able to really think and solve problems. The education system today fails to see that the most important things in life—“love, trust, and hope”—are all left out of the curriculum. Students are neglecting to see the bigger picture.

Ken Robinson works internationally with governments and educators in Europe, Asia, the United States, as well as several fortune five hundred companies. He stunned the world in his Ted Talk in 2006, which is the most viewed Ted Talk on the Internet to date; he addressed his personal concern with formal schooling, claiming: “My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.” Schools tend to put Math and English at the top of their hierarchies, and then Sciences and Humanities to follow, with Arts on the bottom. The de-emphasis on arts and critical thinking in class is limiting children’s creativity.

Robinson tells a very interesting story about a girl who didn’t seem to pay attention in school, but found her vision in art class. One day in art class she was drawing a picture and the teacher asked what she was doing and she replied with “I’m drawing god.” The teacher seemed extremely surprised and replied, “But nobody knows what god looks like,” to which student responded: “Well now they do.” Robinson uses this as one of his many points as to why creativity is stunted in classrooms. He argues that today in the classroom children are afraid to not only be wrong, but also be different. Children, however, learn from their mistakes, through trial and error. If they (students) are so afraid to try because of the possibility of failure, how will they learn?

Robinson stresses that learning must have the following dimensions: it must be social, human, and artistic. He speaks about the education system in America as being test-centric and akin to a business or industrial process. This new process is depriving children of creative thinking. Therefore, he comes up with a theory comprised of three principles that allow the human mind to flourish. The first holds that humans are naturally different and diverse; the second maintains that curiosity makes us learn almost without assistance (teachers should not teach but facilitate learning); and the last posits that humans are naturally creative. The education system is focusing on conformity and test taking, which go against Robinson’s fundamental human learning characteristics. Robinson suggests three guidelines that teachers should teach by: they must individualize teaching and learning, even while a higher status should be accorded to their jobs and teacher development more broadly. Finally, schools must remain responsible for getting the job done.

Robinson also states that he is not opposed to standardized tests, but believes that they should be placement tests used to help learning instead of the only way students’ knowledge and success are measured. He supports the Finnish schools, which use very little standardized testing, and have a zero percent dropout rate. However, he also claims “No school is better than its teachers”. He reiterates that a teacher must spark curiosity in their students, provoking and engaging them in class.

Robinson also questions the idea that there is a rise in hyperactive children. This idea that hyperactive disorders are being over-diagnosed is further shown in Elizabeth Weils personal study with her own school district. In her article “Self Regulation: American Schools Failing Non-Conformist Kids,” she discusses her own personal experience with her son that led her to conduct a study at a local nearby school. Her son’s teacher was discussing some behavioral problems that he had in class, but her son’s grades were much higher than average. After conducting a study on local lower school students, who were almost entirely recommended for mental illness testing due to their dislike of sitting quiet and cross-legged for a long period of class-time, Weils discovered a lack of discipline from the authority figures (teachers). In her own interaction with a teacher, she asked if her child had been disciplined for speaking out of turn or being a distraction, and the teacher responded “No”. Instead, she was told that her child lacked self-regulation. Many other parents were being told the same: that their children had some type of behavioral problem because they did not fit the mold of what the teachers thought kids should be like. Weils describes this as “your child’s teacher tells you your child is not showing appropriate emotional regulation. You’re directed toward psychological evaluations and therapists. They have a hammer. Your kid becomes the nail.” Kids are over-diagnosed and forced to change from who they really are into something they’re not because they’re slightly more talkative or don’t sit still as well. Schools are also cutting back on their free-time activities like gym class, art, and recess. This lack of time to just relax and rejuvenate young and bright minds could be affecting students’ performances in the classroom.

Tim Elmore, best-selling author and founder and President of Growing Leaders, reflects on his own personal change from loving to “play” school with his sister to having a strong dislike for school. He developed this uneasiness over school when it switched to being an entirely left side of the brain activity (the left side of the brain is about facts, while the right side is about creativity). He describes the left side of the brain as calculated and definitive, and the right side as innovative and dynamic. The poor economy has resulted in art and music classes being cut across the country. When Elmore met with the best teachers of the year in Georgia he realized these teachers were so great because they combined the right and left side of brain in their teaching. These teachers confirmed that most teachers and schools teach:
<ul>
	<li>test questions that aren’t relevant</li>
	<li>drills for memory rather than critical thinking</li>
	<li>curricula that doesn’t provide the big picture</li>
	<li>a 20th-century curriculum for a 21st-century world.</li>
</ul>
One teacher said, “A child educated in the classroom is an uneducated child.”

Tim Elmore has since then changed his teaching methods, keeping the acronym ICE in mind, which stands for Images that lead to Conversations that lead to Experiences. Elmore is trying to teach timeless principles in a “right” side of the brain way including images, questions, stories, and exercises. The books his program uses are short and incorporate a lot of podcasts, videos streams, and PDF downloads. This style of teaching enforces the idea that “a picture is worth a thousand words”: instead of having children memorize information, the lessons have them forming their own ideas from the images in front of them. Then the conversations lead to an experience that the students will share with one another, with the goal of  hese experiences changing them.

In Alfie’s Kohn’s “Case Against Grades,” he interviews many students about their experience once they received letter grades. One student in 2006 named Claire said “I remember the first time that a grading rubric was attached to a piece of my writing….Suddenly all the joy was taken away.  I was writing for a grade — I was no longer exploring for me.  I want to get that back.  Will I ever get that back?” She raises the question that is heavily debated by educators. Kohn suggests that teachers gathering information and sharing it with students and parents do not require tests or grading. Kohn reviewed a study from the 90s where kids were studied from elementary through college; half received letter grades and the others didn’t. The students who received grades tended to have much less interest in what they were studying, reducing the quality of their ability to think, and leading them to prefer the easiest and least risky way to complete tasks. He argues that schools have shifted from a “learning orientation” to a “grading orientation” where students are so focused on getting good grades that they forget about the importance of learning how to think; students are less likely to take a risk in learning. In an independent reading essay, students are more likely to pick a short and easy to read book rather than one that challenges them intellectually because they are so focused on getting a good grade that they don’t take a risk. Students are receiving the message that getting good grades is much more important than actually learning. What kind of a message is this for future leaders of the world? How are they supposed to solve global problems like poverty or the energy crisis when they are not learning to think creatively?

		<title>Is It Really Harder to Get into College? A Look Inside the World of College Admissions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Odds are that at one point in your life you had some serious stress about getting into college. Whether you’ve already been through the exhausting process (if you don’t want to remember it, you can stop reading; I’ll understand) or you’re in your junior year of high school and the reality just hit you square in the face, you’re going to have felt some heat from the whole college thing at some point or another. What I’m going to be doing to the best of my ability is trying to help those of you stressing over getting into school move past these fears with some facts. While I won’t have the answers to everything, my goal is to at least ease some of your major concerns with information and some educated inferences about getting into schools. Ultimately, I want to answer the question: is it really harder to get into schools “these days”?

Now I know if you’re a junior like myself, and have at least a quarter of the concern about college that I have, you’re most likely asking yourself a slew of questions: Do I have the grades? Do I do enough extra curricular activities? Do they like kids like me? How do my SATs and ACTs stand for this school? What’s the acceptance rate? Will my parents be happy? These questions and many others will most likely taunt you until you ultimately make your decision about where you want to go on to higher education. When these questions begin to worry you just remember: where you go to school doesn’t determine the rest of your life. It won’t ruin your chance of being successful if you don’t get into Harvard. Just remember that you want to be really happy where you end up going to school, because you can’t be functional if you want to go home every chance you get.

Speaking of what makes you happy, I just want to explain a few things to you about what we’re going to be going over about the college process. One: why are the college acceptance rates getting lower? Two: easy ways you can see where you stand (grade-wise and test-wise) for the school you would like to attend, and other things you would like to know about your school. Finally, we will conclude with a consideration of the factors that make it harder to get into college now than in the past.

So let’s start with some basic numbers. A lot of times students, including myself, judge their own ability to get into college after they google search the acceptance rates at their desired school. And I will be the first to admit that when I realized I wouldn’t be able to get into Stanford with a B+/A- average, I almost cried. But I digress; don’t let these acceptance rates discourage you at all. It is important to know some basic statistics before you freak out and think your life is over, only because you didn’t get into the school that you and your parents have dreamed about.

Something that I do a lot is google college statistics. The statistic I pay the most attention to, though, is the acceptance rate. Based off of these magical numbers, I feel as though I have a good sense of whether I would be able to get in or not. 40% and higher is a safety, 30% to 40% is a good contemporary school, and anything lower than 20% is more than a stone’s throw across the grand canyon with no arms away. But as my googling and “college research” gets more frequent, something scary is beginning to happen. These acceptance rates are getting smaller and smaller. So questions that have been running through my head and will undoubtedly bother some of you are: Why are they getting smaller? What effect will this have on me? Is it now that much harder to get into this school? The answer based of my research is… (Drumroll) NO! It is actually not impairing your chances of acceptance into a school. Instead, it is a numbers thing. Back in the day (1600-1960) not many people were going to college, nor were there many colleges in the United States to attend besides the Ivys (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, UPenn, Dartmouth, Brown and Cornell) and a couple other public universities. If you were even going to be able to pay or attend college you would be going to those schools. Imagine that: if only you were born 200 years ago, you would be able to pick which Ivy League you would attend. While that isn’t the case now, there’s a lot of good about it. There are thousands of great schools in the United States today, which students from all parts of the country and world to attend. Since there are more schools, one would think that the number of students applying would spread itself out nicely over these schools. That’s wrong. In addition to more people applying to schools, people are applying to way more than one school. For the most part people apply to around 6 or 7 schools on average. Meaning that if 100,000 students apply to 6 schools each, there are 600,000 applications circulating throughout various universities. This is the reason for the lowering acceptance rates, but in reality it’s a kind of illusion. Schools generally admit a preset number of people, meaning that out of the number of applications they receive, they will accept a certain number of kids. For reference here is a graph of the increasing number of students applying to schools.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

While the numbers are substantially smaller than the actual numbers of students who have applied, this is meant to be a representation of the current application numbers on a smaller and more fathomable scale. With a small drop in applicants over the past two years, it is easy to spot that the numbers are once again increasing, meaning that the acceptance rates will drop. If one is to look at this process as a game of numbers, the whole “dropping acceptance rate” is really just an illusion.  Nothing has changed except the number of students who have applied. Another factor that leads to the overall number of students admitted is the resources the school has to offer, such as food, dorm space, living space, class size, and many others. With an increasing number of applicants, schools like Hofstra University recently built new dorm complexes to accommodate the larger number of students that applied. Yet a school such as LeMoyne University will be lowering its admittance numbers due to the fact it was difficult to provide enough resources for the record number of applicants this year.

Looking at this whole college thing, it is fair to say that the world is changing. People’s lust to learn has led many more ambitious young minds to push themselves and achieve higher learning. As the world becomes more advanced, we as a society need to adapt in order to stay with it and not fall behind. It’s a good thing for society, but at some point you will sit and say to yourself, “Hey, why is it that schools’ admissions rates are dropping?” Hopefully what you just read has put some of your college fears to rest and put much of the process in perspective. Researching for this article has definitely eased some stress on my part, so hopefully that rubs off on you. So back to my initial question: is it really harder to get into college? In my opinion, and based off my findings, I must conclude no. As I previously mentioned, the number of students applying has increased while the number admitted stays the same. Don’t let that get to your head though; you should get into at least one school you apply to, but you could also be rejected as easily. Even so, it’s possible that the school just wasn’t for you, meaning you just dodged a major bullet. I mean, who wants to spend four years at a place they didn’t even like or only their parents liked. That brings be to my final point: without looking at the numbers, or the endowment, or the success of alumni, or even how great the name looks on a resume, you ultimately want to go to a school that makes you feel happy. So when it comes down to it, pick a school that feels right to you, and don’t panic: the odds are actually in your favor.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Should Division One Athletes Be Paid?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine working for 43 hours a week. On average, you and your fellow employees generate your employer $876,650. You would expect to be compensated handsomely. What if you did all this, and still received no financial compensation from your company? This scenario may seem unbelievable, as employers would pay to receive this type of profit from employees. However, this happens every day with division one athletes. They pour their heart and soul into their sport, dedicating time, hours, and physical effort for the school. And schools earn handsomely off of athletes: Michigan earned over 150 million dollars from its football team alone. Division one athletes work and earn like elite members of our society; it’s time they receive.

Take March Madness for example. The NCAA makes over a billion from TV deals for the tournament, a sum comparable to the super bowl. NFL players often have super bowl clauses built into their contract, so they are fairly compensated for the money they bring in. March Madness is a tournament between the top 64 basketball teams, and the schools’ players had to put in unbelievable amounts of time in order to reach the tournament. The tournament greatly benefits the schools, but the players—the people who the credit belongs to—receive no compensation.

One example of this was the MVP of the NCAA tournament last year, Shabzz Napier. Widely considered the best player in college basketball, Shabzz often would burn over 5,000 calories a day, but did not have the money to buy food. Shabzz called attention to the injustice in this scenario: he was bringing in millions to his school, but could not afford to eat. To be fair, the NCAA responded, declaring that free food should go to all division one athletes. This is a step in the right direction, but Shabbz still does not have the money to live the life of an average college student.

Not only do schools make money from ticket sales and merchandise, they also make tons of money from TV networks. As part of its conference, the ACC has several deals with major broadcasting programs such as Fox and ESPN. Last year alone, these deals brought in 258 million for the conference, or roughly 20 million per school. Duke’s income from broadcasting deals brought in enough revenue to cover the expenses of all other sports, so the money they made from merchandise and tickets was pure profit for the school. Despite all the money the school was making off of him, Duke star Quinn Cook still did not have the cash to go to the movies with his teammates and still have money for dinner. Since Cook dedicated all his free time to basketball, bringing in money for the school in the process, he did not have the time to work a job in order to make walking around cash. Schools ask athletes to work without any financial compensation, despite the fact that many athletes come from backgrounds that make it difficult for them to have money to socialize or buy textbooks without working a second job.

Also, in denying athletes compensation, the NCAA is defeating its purpose, as more and more high school athletes decide to go overseas rather than go to college. For the basketball recruiting class of 2014, Emmanuel Mudiay was ranked as a top three recruit in the country. Mudiay originally committed to Southern Methodist University, but he revoked his commitment when he was offered a spot overseas. A Chinese basketball team offered Mudiay a one-year, 1.2 million-dollar contract—an offer that Mudiay could not resist. Mudiay needed the money to provide for his family, and so the decision was a no-brainer.

The decision to attend school overseas defeats the purpose of the NCAA because the NCAA claims that the primary purpose of the organization is the education of the athletes. The professional sports leagues have done their best to promote going to college, as athletes can no longer go directly to the league out of high school. However, when choosing between getting an education and making sure their mothers have safe places to live, most athletes will choose providing for their families. Furthermore, coming out of high school, 18 year-old kids cannot be expected to give up money for their education. Instead of making kids choose, the NCAA should set up a trust fund for the kids: they can access the money on a limited basis in college, and once they graduate, they receive their full earnings as a more responsible twenty two year old.

NCAA athletes also face an extreme risk participating in college-level athletics.  In men’s football, student athletes can have future brain damage, with six out of every seven concussions going unreported. Athletes essentially get by in school in order for the shot to play pro sports. This works out great sometimes, as some athletes achieve their dream of playing pro sports. However, many of these athletes are never good enough and end up wasting away their college education with nothing to show for it. Another common scenario is a career-ending injury. For example, Marcus Lattimore was a star running back at South Carolina, primed to make millions in the NFL. However, his senior year he tore his ACL, and did not get an NFL contract. Lattimore worked tirelessly during his college years, bringing in millions to his school. Despite this, Lattimore does not have a dime to his name. This disparity in money received versus money earned cannot continue.

Furthermore, of those athletes who turn professional, half are broke within five years of retirement. Take Allen Iverson for example. During his playing career, Iverson earned over 200 million dollars. Within five years of retirement, he declared bankruptcy. A combination of bad investments coupled with requests for money by friends lead him to waste away his earnings. This problem could be avoided if anticipated. Athletes from impoverished neighborhoods often return home after making millions to face old ties and demands; if college and professional sporting organizations could prepare them to anticipate long-term budgets, they would be able to negotiate this transition more easily, and benefit the people they care about in the process.

So the NCAA has a problem, but what is the solution? It obviously does not condone a salary for athletes, partially due to liability issues. The NCAA would come under a scathing attack if money received from the organization were used to buy drugs or other illegal substances. So if the NCAA cannot pay their athletes a salary, what can they do? What the NCAA should do is to give the athletes a delayed salary. Athletes should receive a delayed check from the NCAA: once they graduate college, they should receive a check for their dedication and commitment to the school. Many athletes go broke within five years of retiring from their sport, so colleges should go out of their way in order to educate athletes in finance. Coming out of college with a solid background in money management and a solid base, athletes would be much better off.

		<title>The “Line” for the Media</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2015/02/06/the-line-for-the-media/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[2014 was an eventful year for sure. The Ferguson riots, the Donald Sterling Drama, and ISIS all were in this year’s headlines. The news teams sure had their work cut out for them. But through all this, the media should have been a bit more careful in how they covered certain topics. Historically, and in 2014 for that matter, there have been several instances of media teams covering and writing articles about certain topics in a way that was inappropriate.

Media coverage is important in our everyday lives: it serves as a way for us to get information on what’s important in our world at the time. Yet, there have been some questionable media reports of late. For example, did TMZ really need to release a video of Ray Rice abusing his wife? Everyone knew it had happened, so was it really necessary to show something that should have been private? Although I do not agree with the actions that Ray Rice took against his wife, it was extremely unprofessional to release his private information into the rest of the world. Another big story in the sports world this year was everything that followed Donald Sterling. Again, his views were disgusting and he deserved to get in trouble, but his phone call was recorded without his consent, which is illegal, and then released by several media outlets. Yes, what he said was not okay, but releasing his private phone calls without his consent isn’t okay. One final example of inappropriate news coverage in the sports world is the reportage on Michael Sam. Earlier this year, ESPN, the undisputed king of the jungle in sports news, released an extremely inappropriate report about Michael Sam. Michael Sam, if you didn’t know, was the first openly gay player to get drafted into the NFL. He should have been viewed as a trailblazer and a pioneer for showing that sexual orientation doesn’t matter and anyone can lace up a pair of cleats and go out onto a football field. Instead ESPN released a report letting everyone know that Michael Sam’s teammates didn’t mind having a homosexual shower in their locker room. Although ESPN did apologize after, it just makes viewers wonder why things are covered in this way.

Moving away from sports and into health, the biggest health concern in 2014 was Ebola. Yes, Ebola was very scary to think about, but the odds of someone getting it were low. And yet, everybody panicked. There is a finger to point as to who freaked everyone out regarding Ebola and that finger goes directly to the media teams. The major news outlets have a bad habit of constantly talking about the same topics for days and weeks on end. The Ebola scare was no exception. It was important to have coverage on Ebola, but it became a bigger health concern than it should have been. The news outlets should have been writing many informational articles about why we should be worried about the unlikely chance of contracting Ebola. Instead, this article, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26835233">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26835233</a>, is titled: “Why Ebola is Dangerous”. It’s hard to understand why news outlets are trying to give their readers such frightening news.

The same questions apply to coverage of celebrities. How must it be for famous people? Sure, there is quite a bit of negative publicity that celebrities bring upon themselves, yet just imagine… Every move you make, everything you say, is all being looked at and twisted and turned by TMZ. The site for TMZ is literally titled celebrity gossip. Nobody likes a gossiper in the lunchroom, but then why is it okay for someone to release gossip to be seen by millions of people? These gossip news outlets have been a negative influence on the youth of America. Certain articles can teach children to make assumptions. For example, I just pulled up the TMZ website and one the first articles that came up was this: <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/12/11/tyga-anjali-ranadive-sacramento-kings-video-jet/?adid=hero5">http://www.tmz.com/2014/12/11/tyga-anjali-ranadive-sacramento-kings-video-jet/?adid=hero5</a>. This is an article that rap star “Tyga” might be having some sort of relationship with another lady even though the media highlights his relationship with Kylie Jenner. Is this the type of news that should be reported? Are these the “role models” we want our youth seeing everyday? There seem to be a sentiment that expresses concern with that.

When an article is based more on facts than gossip or interpretation, not only will it come out better, it will also have more credibility. There are certain topics that, because they depend on facts, can also give articles an advantage. For example, elections are a hard thing for the media to mess up due to the fact that they revolve around numbers and statistics. In politics there are specific analysts that can argue for a certain side that they know a lot about. For example, Fox, a conservative media outlet, would be a very credible source for topics concerning the Republican Party. However, while it may be factual, the news they cover and the opinions they offer, still may be biased.

Now why are some of these trickier topics even covered in the first place? Let’s go back to when TMZ released the video of Rice hitting his wife. There are some potential benefits to releasing something like this. For example, releasing this video lets people know that domestic violence is real and lets those might be dealing with domestic violence know that they are not the only ones going through that struggle. What about the topic of Ebola? It was certainly important to let people know that Ebola was happening, but we as a society were also forced to freak out over something that shouldn’t have really been a concern to us. Do we really need to know every little detail of who wore what at the Grammys courtesy of TMZ? Well, maybe we do.

So where exactly does this line begin and end for what media outlets should and should not cover? Well, the answer is going to differ for every person as everyone is going to feel comfortable with different things. It is both a good thing and a bad thing that we as a society will likely never come to a single conclusion on this matter. Many feel that these topics should indeed be covered in these ways while others feel that they should not be covered in that certain way. Some people enjoy reading the type of news that TMZ offers and others feel it is damaging to the youth of our country. It is impossible for everyone to compromise, and it is also impossible to really change the way news is covered in this day and age. This is not to mention how fast news can spread over social media as well. At the end of the day where do you draw your line?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever been unsatisfied with your body? Well, society certainly does not help. Though many factors in today’s society impact the way women of all ages look at themselves, a common element from the 1950s to today is the Barbie doll. When Barbie came out in 1959 girls loved the doll. They looked up to it and they still do today. That’s also when it arguably started to get girls to rethink their own unique body types because people believed that Barbie was “perfect.” In today’s society most younger girls and older women have something about their body that they don’t like. With Barbie’s unrealistic proportions and stick like figure it worsens what women already think of themselves; it also influences girls to look like her, which causes an outbreak of body dissatisfaction. This needs to change! These unrealistic body proportions are not all fun and games when every girl gets a Barbie. All women need to accept their own bodies as beautiful, but how are they going to do that if there are still things in our society like Barbie dolls to make women unhappy with the way they look?

Barbie’s proportions have important ramifications. The contrast between the proportions of the average woman and a Barbie doll is drastic. The only thing that Barbie has in common, proportionally, with the average woman is her head width. They both measure 22”. The neck, bust, biceps, forearms, wrists, waist, hips, thighs, calves, and ankles are not to proportion. Barbie’s body is much smaller, “delicate,” and tiny compared to her head size. If Barbie was a live human, her wrists would be 3.5” inches– the average woman’s is 6-7. That’s a BIG difference. Barbie would not even be able to carry heavy items with such proportions. Barbie’s neck is 9” wide when an average women’s is 12”-13” wide. Barbie would not even be capable of lifting her head if she were real. It is not fair for girls with insecurities—which is most girls—to be influenced by a doll with such unrealistic proportions!

These differences and the ideal body shape Barbie is supposed to embody make females believe their bodies are not good enough. This arguably leads women to eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.  Look at the world we live in: one in ten students has an eating disorder; half of girls 9-10 say they feel better about their physical image while they are dieting; 42% of girls 6-10 wish they were thinner. As well, four out of five 10-year-olds say that they're worried about being fat. For little girls to feel better when they are keeping themselves from eating is completely twisted. Barbie influences these statistics both directly and indirectly. She influences girls directly by being portrayed as the “woman that does it all,” and she also is a popular doll that girls want to play with. She influences girls indirectly by just being in commercials. Barbie is a major influence in girl’s lives.

In response to understandable criticism, the creators of the Barbie doll made a more “realistic” Barbie’s in 2013 and again in 2014. The newer, practical, proportional Barbie has more features to make her more relatable to real women. There is a new “normal” Barbie which first came out in early 2014. The proportions this Barbie were designed to have are the proportions of an average 19 year old. Barbie, however, this Barbie arguably still doesn’t look so average. She has perfect hair perfect skin and makeup done to look pristine. About a month ago the same designer that created the “normal” Barbie created an even more “regular” looking Barbie doll. This new doll has natural brunette hair with very little makeup and cellulite. This doll can be purchased with an expansion pack with tattoos, stretch marks, pimples, and scars, ostensibly to make this Barbie more like the modern woman. The reaction to this doll has been nothing but positive. This is the kind of doll girls and even women can relate to. There have been videos of young girls playing with this new Barbie doll, in which they see that it is normal and perfectly ok to have a scar from a past surgery or a little fat on your stomach. As the designer, <a href="https://lammily.com/">Nickolay Lamm</a>, said “I want to show that average is beautiful”.

I believe that modeling industry affects many women’s view of themselves, but I also believe that dolls such as Barbie influence the modeling industry. The average American women is 5”4 and weighs 166 lbs, and average model is 5”10 and weighs 107 lbs. That is a huge difference and an even bigger problem. There is no question that if people see women’s bodies televised like that they will try to look like that, which causes major problems with self-image and body disorders. Some advertising stores such as Victoria’s Secret publicize pictures of women with what they call the “perfect body”. This is not fair to women who don’t have bodies like the ones they call the “perfect body”—most women don’t! A lot has changed over time with models as well; the perfect body has slowly become skinner, less curvy, and stick-like. To me they’re starting to look malnourished. The picture below shows a Victoria’s Secret model from the early 2000’s in contrast to a Victoria’s Secret model now. The model on the left is more voluptuous and curvy and the one on the right looks like a skeleton. It’s crazy to me that girls are looking up to a girl that probably has one meal a week and works out every second of every day.

The clothing industry is also a factor in how women see themselves. How often do you hear girls say that they want to go down a size? Or two? Or three?! Well, Buzzfeed has explored clothing sizes by having one model try on size sixteen jeans in ten different designers. The results proved that you shouldn’t trust clothing sizes. Girls’ bodies are all different! There can’t be one size for a lot of girls; it just wouldn’t make sense! The model fit differently in all of the brands—some were too small, some too big, and rarely just right. Some women think that if you’re not the perfect 0 or 2 or 24 or 25, you’re too fat. All of the brands that this model tried on said they were 16, yet Jessica Simpson brand, Arizona brand, and Jones New York were way too tight. She couldn’t even button them! In contrast, the brand Decree was too big. Forever21 plus, Liz Claiborne, and NYDJ fit almost right. This proves that you can’t just go by one size. So women: stop thinking that you have to narrow yourself to one size!!!! Because you are more than just one size—you can be a range of sizes. Obsession with sizing is what leads to body disorders. This MUST change. I for one used to think that if I couldn’t fit into the smallest pair of jeans I wasn’t skinny enough. I finally came to the realization that what makes us beautiful as women is the fact that our bodies are unique and special. In reality we should all have our outfits customized!

Photoshop and the retouching of fashion photos is a frequent thing editors do to women’s bodies on magazines, websites, etc. Brands and magazines use Photoshop to edit models’ skin, hair, cellulite, and other “flaws.” Let me remind you that the models that are being retouched are models that already have unrealistic body proportions. Photoshop is not even a shock to people anymore: when they find out that a celebrity or model was Photoshopped in an ad campaign they are rarely if ever surprised. A popular video that has circled around the web for a few years, which is also on Upworthy.com, was about a woman that underwent tremendous changes. Her eyes were expanded, nose readjusted, lips defined, stomach taken in two sizes, neck and legs lengthened, and posterior tightened. Then they evened out her complexion and brightened her skin tone. This goes to show that magazines won’t rely on beauty alone; they have to accentuate it to an unrealistic standard. Women of all ages end up looking up to this standard that they can’t ever fully achieve. This is why one brand in particular, ModCloth, has banned Photoshop on all of their photos. Their view is that they want more realistic looking models to show women that no one looks like the mold the fashion industry has shaped people into. We need more people to come together to fix this twisted perception of beauty that we labor under.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“<i>Senioritis”</i>: A supposed affliction of students in their final year of high school or college, characterized by a decline in motivation or performance.

Senioritis is an epidemic affecting high school seniors nationwide. The symptoms, including incompletion of homework, frequent absences, and lateness, first appear after a college acceptance is received [note: in some cases, the symptoms can appear as early as application submissions]. An acceptance letter gives kids the chance to breathe: finally, after years of working hard in school, months of studying for standardized tests and writing college essay upon college essay, the payoff is tangible. But more often than not, that same acceptance letter is the catalyst for Senioritis. A student once found buried in textbooks in the library can be found lounging in their future school’s sweatshirt out on the quad after receiving an offer of admission to their dream school. Among seniors there is an omnipresent and problematic eagerness to graduate and move onto the next phase in their lives.

As the second semester is now upon us, more and more cases of Senioritis will surface at Friends Academy.  Our school emphasizes college as one of its main goals for its graduates. As stated in the Upper School section of FA’s website,

“Friends Academy's Upper School <a href="http://www.fa.org/uploaded/US_Attachments/2014-15_US_Course_of_Study.pdf">curriculum</a> is a vigorous college preparatory program rooted in the liberal arts and sciences, enhanced by programs critical for developing 21st-century skills and knowledge. Our graduates are prepared to pursue their college aspirations and to use their education for the betterment of the community at large.”

The finish line is unclear: students see it as college admittance, but administration sees it as graduation. In her blog, Mrs. Schoman says the Upper School strives to create “an environment that fosters a love of learning.” But how is it that seniors, even those who love to learn, come down with senioritis once their spots at colleges have been secured and have no desire to engage in academics? In September, students arrive energized and eager to take on the new school year and its challenges. However motivation for a student in September of their senior year versus April of their senior year varies greatly. Students deserve to enjoy the relief from stress and should focus on enjoying their last months, but when the level of their performance and interest in school decline significantly post college acceptance, this decline must be investigated.

Under scrutiny, it is evident that Senioritis--its causes and symptoms--is driven by a social behavior. Many high school seniors are motivated by “competition with other peers and, in the long run, [getting into] college,” said Oliver Muran ‘15, a senior in the midst of the chaotic college process. But when goals of college acceptance have been reached, motivation has a way of fizzling out. Having spent the last four years competing with each other for top markings and spots at acclaimed colleges, second semester seniors don’t feel the immense pressure that once hung over heads like a dark cloud.  Senioritis holds a socially contagious nature: even people who aren’t yet accepted to their university of choice feel the effects of the problem.  In her comparative analysis of U.S. high school students’ motivational factors, Debbie Kavanaugh recognized a social aspect among seniors as having “an effect on academic motivation.” Kavanaugh characterizes students as “discouraged” instead of motivated. She notes that “if a discouraged student is prompting a classmate to start trouble, the students in question are sure to consider social ramifications before (non)acting.” “Discouraged” students tend to not care about their classes and the experience of school as they’re only focused on what’s ahead.

Though a root cause and magnitude of Senioritis is ambiguous, there’s no question that this “on to the next” mentality is deeply rooted in a cultural issue. As Mr. Lape put it in a recent interview, “There is (and I've seen this, I've been teaching 40+ years) the growth of a culture [that values] achievement at all costs, even at the cost of character.” While there are more obvious and deliberate problems concerning achievement and integrity, such as cheating, the issue of Senioritis is one that poses a severe threat and it is in its subliminal nature that the threat resides. By mentally “checking out” of the school experience months prior to graduation, students are adding to and the supporting the story of our culture. “Here’s the story that that culture tells: the purpose of an education is to build a resume (of academics, arts, athletics). With that resume you get into a good college, which gets you a good job, and good money, which gets you a good life,” Mr. Lape explained. Now of course trying for individual success is commendable, but a mindset preoccupied with achievement and resume building is not. Applying oneself in school is still a necessity. Students with a complacent attitude post-acceptance tend to lose their understanding of moral ground. Mr. Lape continued, “Personal responsibility and character have been lost, and parents too want the good grade, for good college and the good life… what good is this [life] story when kids freak out because they don't have the character to deal with crisis on their own?” He pointed out that for AP classes, students are required to sign a contract agreeing to take the AP examination in May. Many students take an AP course because they are challenging, and not to mention impressive to admissions officers reading a transcript. Mr. Lape also recognized that a lot of the time, a student’s future school won’t accept the AP credit , so they choose to “blow off the test… it becomes a point of pride [for a student] to get a 2 or a 1, to show they don’t need to care about it because they’re into college. It’s really upsetting to teachers who believe their subject matter is important,” and believe in their role shaping each student into “someone who will become a force of kindness and hard work.” It is for reasons like these that teachers sigh and shake their heads at hearing the word “senioritis.” The most unsatisfying thing for teachers who want to instill a passion for learning in their students is unmotivated and disengaged students.

When students don’t view the assignment at hand as a learning opportunity, but rather something to check off their to-do lists, the sense of purpose in learning is gone. In order to recapture the excitement in classrooms, we must remember that “we aren’t just individuals seeking our own private gain, we owe things to these groups and communities that have claims on us,” as Mr. Lape put it. As a school, Friends Academy does a great job of reminding students that we serve a purpose in our community and we can always learn from that.

Although they’re out of the classroom after May 1st, Seniors are still engaged in learning through the Independent Service Project (ISP). On the FA website, the ISP is described as, “ a two or three week opportunity at the end of May or beginning of June for seniors to pursue activities and studies in the community. Each senior designs a project that is reviewed by an ISP committee, composed of faculty and students....Upon completion of the project, the student gives a presentation to the seniors and the ISP committee. The ISP committee rates the project as satisfactory or unsatisfactory, and this rating goes on the student’s official transcript. The student must earn a grade of satisfactory to fulfill the graduation requirement.”

While they aren’t from a textbook, the lessons taught through the ISP reinforce the moral code of Friends Academy. Through the ISP, students are reminded to involve themselves in community organizations that they find meaningful. This not only gives kids the chance to learn about and experience something they’re really interested in, but also helps to solidify their connections to the community and service- oriented goals of our school. ISP gives Friends Academy students an understanding that our learning experiences aren’t just valued in terms of grades; we are strong morally and have the power to as a community reach out to seniors and involve them in what should be the most unique learning time, where they aren’t preoccupied with stress about getting grades for a certain college, but rather where they can enjoy learning for the pure experience of what is it: teachers assigning presentations and kids immersing themselves in projects that inspire them.

Now this issue is two sided. As a Senior embarking on her second semester, I sympathize with my peers, Like many, I’m excited to hang out on the quad and enjoy my last days at Friends with my own friends. But I’m certain that FA’s taught me enough about morality and responsibility that I can welcome the next chapter in my life while still keeping up with the current one. Senioritis may be real, but FA has provided students with the moral tools necessary to battle the disease.

		<title>The Evolution of Modeling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the early nineteenth century when modeling first began, it has evolved in mental and physical way, impacting models and society.  The overall effect of this evolution has been negative, creating negative and unrealistic images of young men and women all over the world.  Studies show that these idealized images can and have lead to eating disorders, along with various mental health issues, and suicide.  There seems to be a silver lining on the horizon, as many modeling agencies have changed their portrayal of models to include healthier images, which hopefully will inspire an industry-wide change.

Modeling pays well, and the industry continues to attract more and more people, despite the serious risks involved.  The climb to get to the top includes models “starving themselves to attain a level of thinness that the business desires,” which means fighting their health and wellbeing. How much money is worth jeopardizing your health, when the risks involved are not only severe, but possibly also irreversible? Though male models are affected by aspiring to this ideal image, female models are most susceptible to this pressure to be super thin.  From a young age, girls everywhere idolize the “perfect image” of models and dream of looking like this themselves. Celebrities also appear thin on television, film, and magazines, making it seem like a more natural and desirable goal for today’s young women to be thin. Unfortunately, just like most models, who go through pain to achieve their goal of getting thin, young girls everywhere suffer from eating disorders and other illnesses related to poor nutrition. Publicity has recently exposed data that shows the average American woman as 5’4” and weighing 166 pounds.  In stark contrast is the average American model: 5’11” in height, and in weight only 117 pounds. This contrast reveals how unrealistic and harmful a goal it is for young women to aspire to model-type bodies.

Advertisers focus on physical attributes in an attempt to sell products.  Indeed, magazines feature billions of dollars worth of diet and exercise advertisements. Some researchers claim that these advertisers perpetuate unrealistically thin body types in order to create an unattainable dream that will increase diet-related product consumption.  Sadly, these advertisements are an effective mechanism to create “body dissatisfaction to their readers through unrealistic images of women.”  In the 1930s, Marilyn Monroe was known to have had the ideal body shape for all women.  Monroe was a size 6.  However, by today’s media standards Monroe would actually be considered large, as today’s model is no larger than a size 2, making women without this unusually thin and rare body type feel physically and emotionally inferior and insecure.

Recently, an interesting study was done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which focused on women from ages eighteen through twenty- four.  The focus of this study was the specific effect a magazine’s portrayal of the “ideal” body has on a college woman’s body image.  The frequency analysis reports that the majority of women were between 5’3” and 5’8”, weighing 110-149 pounds.  Seventy-five percent of these women were occasionally or frequently happy with their body shape and size.  However, sixty percent of the respondents hardly or never felt that their body was ‘normal’ compared to magazine depictions. Forty- three percent sometimes or nearly always felt that female models depicted in magazines have the ideal body shape and size. Of the college respondents, seventy-three percent sometimes or always felt that they would be more attractive if they looked like a magazine model.  Nonetheless, seventy-three percent rarely or never felt that having their body looking similar to those of fashion models would be good for their health.  This is just one example exposing the negative modeling image that has been portrayed on young women all over the world.

Modeling is a very attractive profession, given the financial benefits, not to mention the perks that come with being a model, such as free beauty products and glamorous events.  Young women idolize the beauty of models and therefore look to copy their body type amongst other attributes.  Hopefully, the growing awareness of the dangers models undergo to obtain their super thin and unrealistic bodies will create a climate of change whereby young women no longer strive to harm their bodies in order to achieve unrealistic thinness.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Senior Prom: Should girls ask boys to prom? Should there be a restriction on boys asking girls to prom because of a fear that girls will never do it? Is this a valid social experiment? </i>

Senior Prom. Did you feel that? The automatic rush of nerves, and endless questions flooding your head? The biggest question of all—who will I go with? For girls, we are worried that the boy of our choice won’t ask us, or that we won’t be asked at all.  For boys, the anxiety stems from the girl’s response- what if she says no? Prom is bound to involve stress, but that stress—such as shopping for a dress and shoes, and getting your hair done—can be quite enjoyable. With society’s views radically shifting away from traditionalism, we can’t help but question gender norms set in our society, and more specifically, norms about prom. Feminist scholar Toril Moi wrote, “The task of feminist critics and theorists is to expose the way in which male dominance over females constitutes.” Therefore, by working to unveil the “male dominance,” we can successfully deploy our pluralistic ideals.

Defined by the New Oxford American Dictionary, Prom is “a formal dance, esp. one held by a class in high school or college at the end of a year.” There is no written rule that girls cannot ask boys. I can confidently say this is OUR prom and others would agree as well. Therefore, I raise the question of removing the stress portion of prom and propose a temporary fix… should we promote the notion of girls asking boys to prom?

According to a classic Friends Academy teacher, Herb Lape—a man who truly believes in chivalry and classical dance but sometimes with a little <i>twist</i>—“It [girls asking boys to Prom] goes against the tradition in every culture; the question is not just tradition, it is also biology. But, as you know it’s not a huge issue for me, but it does raise interesting questions.” Yes, indeed, it does raise some good questions.

Senior Struan Coleman says, “I think they should. I did it last year and it was fun, but I don’t think it’s fair that the pressure should be on me when it’s equally our dance. I think one year the girls should have to ask the boys.” Although Struan exemplifies a touch of laziness, he does make a fair point that if the boys did it last year, it’s only fair that the girls ask this year.

On the other hand, feminist Gabby Fitzgerald says, “I always take the stand on women’s leadership but in this case, I feel like tradition is important and the woman has the same power in the situation with the right to say no.” While Gabby’s argument exhibits strong feelings of preserving the annual tradition of prom, she raises another argument that if a girl was asked to prom, and she were to decline the invitation, what would her next move be? Would she feel the empowerment of taking the matter into her own hands, or would she allow the negative stress of prom overcome her? Toril Moi wrote, “Patriarchy, in other words, wants us to believe that there is such a thing as an essence of femaleness, called femininity.” According to the New Oxford American Dictionary, femininity is a term used to describe “the quality of being female; womanliness.” As an example of how the word is used in a sentence, they wrote, “she celebrates her femininity by wearing makeup and high heels.” So what they’re implying is that the way women celebrate gender is through putting on mascara and wearing high heels. Well, personally, I like to celebrate my femininity by writing and working at my job. On the other hand, the definition for masculinity in the New Oxford American Dictionary is, “possession of the qualities traditionally associated with men.” As an example of how the word is used in a sentence, they wrote, “a need for men to prove their masculinity through domination over women.” Notice how the words “possession” and “domination” are used.

Overall, I feel that as a senior class we redefine boundaries and enter restricted territory- <i>#tbt to the bridge Freshmen year, Project S, etc</i>. When Senior Juliane Florez stated, “if a girl wants to ask then she can,” fellow Senior Alex Valentino interrupted by saying, “That would never go over; the only reason why it won’t switch is because the girls won’t ask.”  So, our challenge as the school year progresses is… how can we, as a grade, preserve our reputation? Toril Moi wrote, “A woman who refuses to conform can be labeled both unfeminine and unnatural.” In order to positively instantiate this change, we must feel empowered as women, rather than afraid of this movement. If we are going to tackle this issue regarding Prom, we must do it full force. Inkwell Editor-in-Chief, Kyle Rosenbluth said, “Restrict them! It’s a cool experiment. You’ve got to break the boundaries of social norms.”

With great pride and our grade’s revolutionary spirit, I am predicting a challenge for whoever said it was only socially acceptable for a boy to ask a girl to Prom. In our community, gender equality is not yet evident. Therefore, this year I challenge the girls to step up and ask a boy to Senior Prom. If we are going to defy gender norms, we might as well start <b>small</b>. Let’s be the start of a new era, and make news headlines while we’re at it. Let’s be the change we want to see in the world.

I entered the auditorium a on March 18th, for what I thought would be a normal assembly. I knew that there were going to be “street performers,” but I had not given much thought to what that would mean. To be honest, I figured it would be a good time to maybe close my eyes for a few minutes and get some rest. Turns out, I was in for a huge surprise. 
	The minute I entered the space and heard the music of our guest artists, Dorise and Tanya, I was hooked. I could not tear my eyes from the stage as their passion and skill hypnotized the students and staff. They played songs I knew, songs I had heard before, but brought their own unique spin to each piece. Their set was unbelievable and it was hard to believe their story and profession. 
	It turns out Tanya and Dorise are street performers from New Orleans. Tracy Foster, Director of the Arts, discovered their music walking down the street on her trip to their city. Fortunately they were able to come play for us and make their beautiful music for the upper school shortly after. I was fascinated by their work and talent, so I asked them to sit down with me over lunch for a brief interview. 

Here is what I asked and discovered about our recent guests: 

So in general I’m interested in how you got to where you are. But to start, I’d like to hear about your music background and how you came to love this form of music. 

Tanya: Ok, I guess we came from different backgrounds. I’m Tanya and I’m from Taiwan. I moved to America when I was four, um, and I started playing the violin when I was six. I grew up with a classical training. It wasn’t till I met Dorise after college that I started playing off the books.And I just love it and I’ve been doing ever since. 

So it was out of your classical training that you came into street performance?

Tanya: Yeah, it gave me a foundation, it taught me how to play my instrument, but, you know, I just took that technique and applied it to pop or all other kinds of genres of music. 

Dorise: Well, I grew up in a kind of musical family. So my aunts and my uncles my cousins my brothers played. So I just learned to play with my family mostly and eventually I, uh, started playing in bands when I was in high school, maybe junior hugh, started playing guitar when I was about twelve. 

What is it that you find special about street performance in particular?

Dorise: well I think the main beauty of street performing, versus other venues, is that it is open to everyone, so anyone passing by- they can be working- the trash people get to hear the music, the homeless people get to hear the music. The waiters when we are in the streets, even if they don’t have a lot of time in their day, they can still get a song or a minute of it as well as tourists and everyone else, just everybody gets to share a common space together. It doesnt matter how much money you have or what you’re doing, you can kind of just drive by your car and get some music. 

That’s so beautiful. Do you have anything to add?

Tanya: Just there aren’t any expectations or anything like that, you know, when you go to a show or a restaurant you expect something- the musicians have to be good. I like how people don’t know what to expect and they can just kind of have a fresh slate in their minds. 

Wonderful, how do you feel the reception is of your music?

Tanya: Anywhere between appreciation and shock, you know. People aren’t expecting to hear two women playing the violin and the guitar and the kinds of music that we play. There’s just a range. 

What role would you say music has played in your life? I know that’s kind of a broad question, but I know for everyone it can be different- by bringing joy or it’s a way of being out of your head- you know. 
Dorise: I think it does all of that. Especially after the storm- since New Orleans is such a musical city it was a way for people to feel that the city was coming back, you know? Just for me, playing, when the city had no electricity and it was very limited resources all around, playing was something that just didn’t change. It just stayed at a certain level and regardless of where I had to sleep or what I had to do… when I played I just kind of was in the same space as if I was in a luxury situation, you know. It was very healing- but not in the sense that I was recovering from any sort of situation, it just stabilized me. 

Tanya: I guess you’re asking the roles music plays in life, um…

In your life in particular, yeah. 

Tanya: For me, I don’t think its very much different from most people who love music. I just always loved listening to music. I love like hearing what’s on the radio. I love watching musicals. I love music just as much as anybody else- so it’s not much different than for anybody else. 

Did playing here, in our auditorium, feel weird to you? Or does playing in other venues feel different?

Dorise: It doesn’t matter where we play. I mean, it was fun playing with the stagg. We just love to play with people, you know? Just to see where people are at, see what they bring insee what their ideas are, you know. It doesn’t matter what kind of music it is though. People just bring what they bring. 

Yeah, that’s awesome.

Tanya: It was just fun. You could tell everyone on the stage and in the audience were just enjoying seeing everybody play- it was fun. 

What are some of the challenges of doing street performance?

Dorise: I mean, it’s no guaranteed income, you know it’s a street and New Orleans has a lot of stuff going on in the streets, it’s not a completely calm city. It has quite a history in the streets, you know? So I guess challenges are just to make it a better place, every day you’re out there it’s just to make the streets better. 

Is there a big street performing community in New Orleans?

Dorise: Yeah, there’s hundreds of people doing it. 

So, why New Orleans as your place to live?

Tanya: It’s warm enough most of the year, so we could play year round if we wanted to, compared to somewhere like here that has four seasons. So that’s part of it. And another part of it is the culture of having street music and the tourism- people coming all the time. There’s always an influx of new people that ready to enjoy themselves, um, yeah. 

That’s great, thank you so much. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-10.34.19-AM.png"><img src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-10.34.19-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-21 at 10.34.19 AM" width="257" height="193" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4157" /></a>

It’s Sunday night and what else is there to do than turn on the TV? A little more than two million people every Sunday choose to watch Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Viewers get to see Kim cry while Kourtney and Scott fight over the same exact thing every week. On another channel, 1.8 million viewers are watching the Real Housewives, despite the fact almost all of the women are no longer wives or do anything “housewife” related. Is it possible that these shows actually affect us?

These so-called “reality” shows are erupting all over pop culture, but should they? Could something so bland, and innocuous as reality TV actually do us harm? There are over three hundred reality shows at the moment, all harshly promoting either one or all of these things: materialism, physical beauty, and bullying. While some shows are based on these principles, many promote them unintentionally.

Beauty has always been important in society, and almost everything nowadays is focused on making you look better. Reality shows, however, take the idea of beauty further. You cannot roam through TV channels without seeing dozens of surgically altered faces. Reality shows such as Bridalplasty, Botched, and The Swan focus on beauty. Bridalplasty revolves around brides who want multiple appearance -altering procedures before their weddings, while The Swan takes an average girl and puts her through a three-month transformation process, so she can compete in a pageant full of other plastic faces. These shows have caused a nationwide phenomenon: plastic surgery. Along with all other surgical procedures, plastic surgery is dangerous. A popular form of cosmetic surgery, tummy tucks, pose a 1 in 500 chance of death. Hundreds of thousands are performed each year. For individuals over 50, a common cosmetic procedure, the face-lift, has a 1 in 600 risk of death. When asked in 2012, 78 percent of patients who received plastic surgery admitted that reality TV was a large influence in their decision.

In almost all reality shows bigger is better; there's always an essence of extravagance.  Yet is that mindset a good thing? With the explosion of reality TV came shows like My Super Sweet Sixteen, which told young people that in order to be happy or popular they needed the most extravagant things in the world. The Rich Kids of Beverly Hills on E!, further expressed the “importance” of materialism. Teens, who are most susceptible to persuasion, become obsessed with the profligate lifestyle of the characters on this show.  During an interview with David Blum for Kindle Singles in 2013, President Barack Obama chastised reality star Kim Kardashian and rapper Kanye West after they spent 827,000 dollars on gold plated toilets. President Obama is firmly against the promotion of materialistic lifestyles and believes celebrities who show off their wealth to fans have unintentionally changed the aspirations of young people. Obama later said, "I don't think people went around saying to themselves, 'I need to have a 10,000-square-foot (3048 square metre) house' [...] I think, there has also been a shift in culture. We weren't exposed to these things, we didn't have it in the same way that kids these days do.” The direct look into the lives of celebrities is altering how we define success.

Within recent years bullying has become a pressing issue and organizations have been created to combat it. While some reality shows involve actual talent and promote life-changing aspirations, such as weight loss, you can’t ignore what most of them are about. According to the logic of these shows, you can stick people in a confined space and/or stressful situation, offer a fat wad of money to the person left standing at the end, and watch them turn on each other. A vital part of reality TV seems to be people ganging up on one another. Many may disagree, finding it amusing and entertaining, or arguing that social harmony may not help ratings. However it is impossible to ignore the fact that there's a ton of lying and manipulation on these shows. Many of the contestants pretend to be friends, only to turn on each other later. We laugh at the name-calling and witty remarks, and can't seem to look away when a fight breaks out. Why is it okay to laugh when at these things on TV, when in real life we would not find it nearly as comical? Are reality shows promoting that bullying? To get what you want and “win the game” you must be mean to others. When did screaming, name calling, and tantrum throwing become an acceptable form of communication?

If it is so bad, why do so many people watch it? Reality TV, while very harmful, isn't completely corrupt. American Idol, The Voice, America’s got Talent, and the X Factor all promote the beauty of natural talent. These shows have positively inspired people around the world. A 2010 America’s got Talent contestant, Ali Christensen Wilde, said, “They literally just followed us around and saw our lives without trying to drum up any drama. They just wanted to see the person and their talent and that’s what it was all about.” The simplicity of the show is what gives it its appeal. People are given the opportunity to follow their dreams and that’s all they have to do. They build themselves up to win, instead of tearing other people down. The Biggest Loser, which premiered in 2004, has inspired many Americans to be more health conscious and work harder for their goals. Bill Germanakos, the season four winner of The Biggest Loser said, "It shows obese people that are helpless and hopeless that there is HOPE and is meant to inspire and motivate those who thought they had tried everything." The show has saved and permanently changed millions of lives.

What many people do not understand is that reality TV is not actual reality. It is true that there is no script, but just because there is no script doesn't make it real. There are writers who craft plotlines, twisting and altering the footage to make a more interesting story. Frankenbiting: this word may seem fake, but it is a term reality TV producers created to describe the art of cutting and pasting dialogue to create a sentence that never existed. This is used to manipulate the viewer and make them believe that what is being said is true. An example of this would be when someone is talking and the camera shifts to another object, but you still hear the person speaking. Many marvel at the lives of the people on these shows, wishing that their lives could be even a fraction as interesting, when the truth is they aren't that unique. In truth, writers and producers craft the lives of the people on these shows, which become a cheaper version of real TV shows.

There are probably many people who still think reality TV is nothing to worry about. They may claim they understand what it is and watch it out of pure boredom. Though that may be true, they are still absorbing everything they see, and promoting it either intentionally or unintentionally. We shouldn't allow these shows to distort what we consider beautiful, meaningful, and morally correct. Remember that these shows aren't real and don't depict a true representation of reality.

If you performed a simple Google search on the term “meninism” about ten years ago, you may have been brought to a link that defined it as “a global organization of men that believe in and support the feminist principles of women's political, social and economic equality” (<a href="http://www.feminist.com">www.feminist.com</a>, 2001). However, make the same Google search today and you’ll get a very different result. The term has been taken over by men on popular social media outlets such as Twitter and Tumblr and given a meaning that is actually the opposite of its previous definition. Today, meninism is most commonly defined as anti-feminism. Men are using the term to mock feminism and take a stand against it. While some claim it’s being used for satirical purposes, others are taking it seriously. The word meninist could have been used for good, and maintained its original meaning—men looking for equality among genders—but unfortunately it has taken on a misogynistic connotation.

So why the shift in meaning? Most likely it’s due to the lack of education provided for teens about gender equality. Boys and men alike think that it’s okay to make degrading jokes about women because they are painfully unaware of how ignorant they are being about a real and prevalent issue in our society. If gender equality was stressed more and woven into curricula starting in high school, a great amount of this degradation would most likely be avoided. People need to learn what the principles of feminism really are, instead of absorbing social media’s misguided perception of what it means to be a feminist. If social media is the sole means by which teens learn about gender equality, then we have a recipe for misconceptions and disaster.

If feminists believe in equality for women, and meninists believe in “equality for men,” doesn’t everyone believe in the same thing? Equality is equality right? Unfortunately, this is not the case. Meninism plays a totally misogynist role on social media. It is being used to belittle and complain about women. With tweets like “ladies, if you have more followers on instagram than you do on twitter it just means dudes like you better when you stfu” coming from a twitter account followed by over 64 thousand people under the name of @theMeninistTwit (who is probably unaware that a “twit” is a stupid person...ironic), it is clear that these types of toxic messages are widely circulated and supported. It is also clear that meninists hold zero respect for women. It would be great if meninists and feminists were really looking to do the same thing, but unfortunately they’re not.

The most common social media platform that meninism is taking over is Twitter. Type in “#meninism” on twitter and you’ll find a plethora of tweets such as “Why do men have to spend our hard earned money on dates, why can [sic] we get asked out, picked up and fed… I like free food too” or “us men should also get a week out of every month to complain and be taken care of, like girls do on their period.” There are multiple accounts with the sole purpose of promoting meninism by making derogatory comments about women such as @MeninismTweet, @TheMeninism, @FunnyMeninist, and many more, some with over 200 thousand followers. One account, @MeninIstTweetz, is particularly confusing due to the contradictory information on the page. Despite the user’s handle, the bio of the account reads “Chivalry isn't dead, women's appreciation is” and the banner picture of the account is a graphic that says “Equality for All.” If this isn’t confusing enough, the tweets from the account are all along the lines of “Ladies, next time a guy has the guts to talk to u, remember he's not wearing makeup. Also remember what u look like without it” and “women are like parking spots, the good ones are taken and the rest are handicapped.” This further proves that meninists actually have no idea what they are talking about. Do they even know what equality means? Two hundred and forty four thousand people follow these tweets, which means that number of people clearly hold minimal respect for women.

There are even t-shirts with the hashtag meninism being worn by men and, shockingly, women too. What “meninists” don’t realize is that feminists are not women that are looking to hold power over men, but in fact women that are seeking to gain equal rights and privileges to that of their male counterparts. By attacking feminism, meninists undermine the idea that they’re looking for gender equality. It’s not feminists that are the problem: it’s those individuals that are discriminatory towards either gender. A great majority of those participating in the meninist movement are young and impressionable and quite frankly uneducated about feminism. They are willing to jump on the bandwagon of something they really know nothing about.

<em>The Huffington Post</em> recently interviewed the originator of the meninist hashtag, 28-year-old Ti Balogun. In the interview he stated:

Meninism was certainly not created with malicious intent, but obviously was a runaway train since it began. It was loosely intended to be satire, but ironically has created an avenue for discussion and knowledge of the other ideals that we share. Feminism has its place in society. There are clearly women that are oppressed, as are those in varying ethnic groups, as well as people in the LBGT community. All of these groups have faced oppressed and are marginalized classes. The feminist movement, in particular, certainly makes society aware of the disadvantages of women specifically, and is an ideal that should be respected and further evaluated by those with limited knowledge. Further, I personally feel equal pay and maternity leave for my wife are of critical importance to our household.

Ironically, Balogun is a self-described feminist. The meninist movement originated as satire, but it has spiraled out of control. The biggest defense you will see by people supporting this “movement” when questioned is that it’s all a big joke. Even if meninism did start out as “satire”, and a large percentage of the people hash tagging “meninist” on twitter aren’t taking it seriously, it’s still hugely disrespectful to women and feminists. By making these jokes, meninists undermine the importance of feminism. One meninist twitter account’s (@TheMeninism) bio is “obviously sarcasm.” It’s an attempt to antagonize women and see them retaliate. Meninism really takes away from the seriousness of gender equality, even if it is just a “joke” to some. While one may only be able to infer that those that consider themselves meninists probably have a low level of maturity and confidence, it could also be that these men belong to a generation that is uneducated about gender equality.

Meninism is, overall, a term used to degrade women. The usage of the term in this way needs to be eliminated in order to achieve gender equality. Whether intended as a joke or not, the only thing meninism results in is a more divided society among men and women. The ultimate objective of everyone in society should be to reach a point in which men and women can be seen as equal in every aspect. Meninism only thwarts this important goal.

     Americans are known as the fat people: those who walk around and have thunder thighs and cankles.  Why do people have this perception of us if it’s not true?  Because in some ways, it is true:  32.2% of men and 35.5% of women in the United States are obese today.  <em>Super Size Me</em>, a documentary that came out about a man who ate only McDonald’s for 30 days straight, looks into one of the largest causes of obesity today: fast food restaurants.  Yes, that includes McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King.  Would you risk gaining 24.5 lbs or more and your cholesterol level rising to 230 in order to have your deep fat fried chicken fingers whenever you wanted?  Well the <em>Super Size Me </em>guy did.

      Now I’m not saying everyone doesn't enjoy or shouldn’t enjoy a fatty food here or there.  I’m just trying to tell people about these foods they are eating.  Let’s look at one meal from McDonald’s: Say you order a premium crispy chicken club sandwich thinking it’s probably a healthy option.  Well, you’re wrong.  This sandwich alone is 680 calories.  Throw in a medium sized fries and you add another 380 calories.  Top it all off with a 32 oz. vanilla triple-thick shake and your meal has just cost you 2,170 calories, already exceeding the daily calorie limit for the average woman.

       People eat fast food for many reasons, including taste, price, and availability.  It’s true: things that are bad for you always taste better than healthy choices.  Most people I know are going to choose the chicken fingers over the salad because people like to enjoy their food, and fast food restaurants know this and use it to their advantage. One of the most glaring factors that these businesses exploit is the desire for cheaper food.  These “restaurants” entice people who can’t afford the newest and healthiest kale salad with their two-dollar menu items.  You also can’t forget that these places are everywhere.  You see one on almost every corner, and when you turn around you get smacked in the face by the McDonald’s logo or approached by some creepy guy dressed as Ronald McDonald. And of course you are also bombarded by the endless amount of commercials you see on T.V.  There are 240,115 fast food restaurants nationwide and they serve 50 million people daily.  That means 50 million people are eating food that can’t even be really called food.  It’s closer to fat wrapped in more fat sprinkled with sugar and salt.  In a 2009 study conducted at the University of California Berkeley, researchers found that the proximity of fast food restaurants is directly linked to weight gain.  The researchers reported that ninth grade students who had a fast food restaurant within one tenth of a mile of the school experienced a five percent increase in obesity.

        There are other reasons why we eat fast food, and the main idea connecting these factors is something common to all of us to a certain degree: laziness.  80% of people surveyed say they eat fast food because it’s easy to get to, while 44% say they just don’t like preparing food themselves.  As a whole, Americans are pretty lazy about a variety of things, and many people are lazy about their food, in particular.  Laziness comes with a lack of attention, which is why more than a third of Americans are obese.  People see nutrition as something that isn’t as important as things like bills or other necessities, but in reality it is.  If you don’t believe this, then just think about all the medical bills you will have to pay for and all the new clothes you will have to buy because you can’t fit into your old ones.  Being obese comes with a whole new set of struggles and responsibilities and laziness is no longer an option.

        Perhaps the biggest misconception about fast food is the result of a lack of education about the industry itself.  There are reports that talk about the harmful effects of fast food, but this information is either not open to or not reaching the public.  In a recent survey, 21% of people said they like fast food restaurants because of the nutritious options they offer.  The only thing close to a “nutritious option” is the Southwest salad at McDonald’s, which has close to four hundred calories.  Four hundred calories for a salad is not healthy, however, because of all the dressing and other toppings mixed in.

        Let’s get away from the numbers, though, and talk about the effects of obesity on Americans today.  Everyone today, especially teenage girls, is pressured by social media and other controlling aspects to be beautiful.  Those girls who strive to be a size 0 and whose families can’t afford anything besides fast food might choose not to eat if that’s the only way of reaching their goal.   The qualities that people associate with beauty are based on how skinny they are.  Teenage girls, influenced by their surroundings, take this in and believe it.  The truth is, not everyone can look like a Victoria’s Secret model no matter how hard they try.  These models, on average, are 5’10” and weigh only 115 pounds.  On average, the healthy recommended weight for a 5’10” female is 150 pounds.  That means girls are looking at these models and thinking they need to lose 35 pounds in order to be beautiful.   Girls that don't fit this perfect mold, in turn, have lower self-esteem, which can lead to many other problems, both mental and physical.  But you can’t put all the blame on social media.  Put the blame on fast food restaurants.

       As I said before, the U.S. is seen as a fat country. Period.  “Skinny countries” such as Japan and India look at us and see obesity. You can’t really blame them.  More than one third of our population is obese and this problem is caused by places like Burger King.  They throw more and more food at us every day.  And why?   Because they just want to make money.  Diseases such as heart problems and diabetes don’t bother them.  As long as their pockets are getting bigger, they don’t mind our pants sizes getting bigger.  Fast food restaurants not only cause health problems: they are also slowly widening the gap between social classes.  The wealthy, those who always appear to be fit and thin, aren’t relying on or regularly eating fast food because they can afford the higher priced and healthier options.  People living near or below the poverty line have no other options besides cheap and, most likely, fatty foods.  People in this country discriminate on hundreds of different things from race to gender to body size, and those who are fit and wealthy are given one more reason as to why they believe they are better than those who are poor.

      In order to fix this stereotype about Americans and our size, we need to change the influence we allow the fast food industry to have on our lives.  Many people in this country would classify fast food as a commodity because they don't know any different.

     To stop this growing epidemic, we first need to limit the amount of calories allowed in any one fast food item.  Fast food is soaked in fat and the only thing it helps increase is the risk of a heart attack.  By limiting the amount of calories in any given meal, we could slowly reduce the odds of obesity in one way.  This would allow people to feel better about what they are eating.

     Fast food not only puts us at risk for social problems, it also increases our risk of health problems.  American journalist Eric Schlosser said, “ The fast food industry is in very good company with the lead industry and the tobacco industry in how it tries to mislead the public, and how aggressively it goes after anybody who criticizes its business practices.”  This shows that, although many might not believe it, smoking tobacco and eating fast food on a regular basis can produce extreme health problems.  Tobacco in cigarettes, as we all know, can lead to cancer, but do we all understand the problems obesity causes?  Obesity leads to coronary heart disease, type two diabetes, different forms of cancer, hypertension, stroke, gallbladder and liver disease, and sleep apnea and breathing problems, along with many other health concerns.  Schlosser perfectly captures the risks when he says, “Fast food is popular because it’s convenient, it’s cheap, and it tastes good.  But the real cost of eating fast food never appears on the menu.”  Obesity is something that many people joke about without understanding its real risks and implications. However, obesity can seriously impact your lifestyle just as much as any other disease.

      Perhaps the most compelling argument against fast food has to do with the risk of death.  Almost all of these diseases can lead to either death or serious health problems in the future.  Many people know smoking and doing drugs is bad for you due to available research, and they now try to avoid these addictions.  However, obesity is just as great a health problem as lung cancer from smoking.  Advertisements play a large role in the differing perspectives about the health risks of cancer and obesity. The legal age for buying cigarettes is 18, while anyone can buy a Big Mac; maybe the latter isn’t as harmful as the former, but they can produce the same effects.  18.1% of Americans today smoke.  This number has dropped significantly because of the research that shows just how harmful it can be.  Commercials regarding cigarettes today are legally required to remind you of the harmful effects of smoking, and other public service commercials show you someone suffering from lung cancer.  It is made as unappealing as possible, but the next commercial about McDonald’s is colorful and attractive, especially to young children.  The reality is, people don’t recognize how harmful these fast food restaurants can be.  They are uneducated, but also in denial that the food from these restaurants can lead to obesity and other health risks.

     Many people might say it is a person’s decision to determine what they put into their bodies, but in reality some don’t have the same amount of control as others.  As I stated before, the wealthy are usually thin.  This is true because the economically sound have access to information about what is and isn’t good for your body and they make decisions about what food they eat.  Most, however, would like to remain healthy and choose the healthier, but also more expensive, options.  Those who are below or at the poverty line would also like to lead healthy and active lives, but they don’t always have that option.  If they can only afford the cheapest meals to feed themselves and their families, they aren’t going to focus on how healthy it is, despite the fact that they really do care about this problem.  They are going to feed their families the food that will leave them full.  This dilemma causes an even greater social gap to form and the bigger it gets, the harder it is to close.  Fast food restaurants not only harm our health—they also separate us further into economic classes.

     Fast food is not the only reason that many Americans are obese today.  However, these restaurants are a major concern and do lead to health problems for many Americans.  We can’t turn our backs on something that is hitting us in the face.  Obesity isn’t something we can risk or see as a small problem.  We can’t “cure” obesity, but we can limit its effects by restricting the calories on meals in fast food restaurants.  Obesity has the power to affect all aspects of person’s life—physical, mental, and social. Fast food restaurants need to be monitored or soon enough we will all have serious health issues on our hands.]]></content:encoded>

You probably don’t realize how many times a day you check your phone for texts, or use the Internet to Google something or check your email. If you were to attempt to count you would probably lose track. Is this a bad thing? As a society, we are constantly doing these things—texting, emailing, checking our phones, looking things up on our computers; technology has become a part of us. In this day and age it is almost essential. We use computers for work, school, research, and communicating with others; the list goes on and on. Technology has become a necessity in our global economy. We use it everyday, whether it is for school, work, or personal use. Cell phones have become one of our main sources of communication, enabling us to speak to others at any time. We use technology every single day without even thinking about it.

But what impact does this have on our society? There are both positive and negative effects. Social media helps businesses and social networks increase communication globally. New opportunities spread through the sharing of ideas online. It is easy to get help on the Internet, and the Internet has become an efficient way to unite people behind the same causes. Still, there are negative effects. Technology often leads to a sort of addiction, a perpetual laziness. Too much use of technology leads to a lack of concentration and a shorter attention span. Cyberbullying is a prevalent issue in society now, as is the accidental sharing of too much information. Social networks also have a way of creating a false sense of connection, as people are not always who they say they are. The impact media has on society is indisputable, whether it is positive or negative. Still, it is important to recognize both the negatives and the positives of technology.

Technology and social networking sites have advanced the business world. The role media plays in increasing communication allows businesses to communicate with other companies worldwide, while also spreading advertising and gaining support. An article from ABC News written by Jon Swartz quotes Ross Mayfield, co-founder of a business software called Socialtext, who has seen first hand the impact social networking has on businesses: "The spread of the workforce has put a premium on tech tools that let people collaborate, learn, and share info from different parts of the world.” He cites statistics that prove 85% of employees have connections with people in other offices. Technology has thus lead to a spread of business and ideas. Technology helps increase business productivity, as online advertising and social media allow companies to extend their messages worldwide almost instantly. Sites like LinkedIn unite businesspeople. Social media has impacted and helped the business industry in many ways, and has allowed for a massive surge in communication.

Access to the Internet creates many new opportunities within itself. Not only does technology allow for the advancement of businesses, it also opens many opportunities in essentially every other field as well. An opportunity the Internet has created is the YouTuber. YouTube has created a new world in which anyone can post videos. This has led to popular viral videos, as well as jobs making YouTube videos. According to the Business Insider, the highest paid YouTuber makes 8.47 million dollars per year, strictly by making videos. Famous, sponsored YouTubers get paid per view, and are often paid to advertise products and media. Whether it is making videos about gaming, makeup, or entertainment, people are now able to make a career out of doing what they love online. Social media has allowed for these opportunities. Simply posting videos sharing what they love, these individuals have launched successful careers. Another way in which the Internet has launched careers is the new concept of “blog to book.” According to LifeHack.org, to get a book contract “all you need is a blog.” This has become a new trend, in which it is easy to publish a book simply by writing and promoting your blog. This blog will then turn into your book, and once you get an agent it is allegedly easy to get a contract. Being a published author is so much simpler with the Internet; it has opened a world of opportunity, not only for existing jobs and businesses, but also for newly created jobs that did not exist before.

Media has had a huge impact on education as well. According to the U.S. Department of Education, technology has created many alternative ways of learning. Full-time online schools and other opportunities to learn online have created many new opportunities. Blended learning allows for learning both in person and online. Not only has technology created new ways of spreading education, it also enhances education. Learning resources are easily accessible on the Internet, and it is now easier for students to communicate with each other and their teachers. The Internet also allows for online gradebooks, making students’ access to their grades and how they are doing in their classes much simpler. The Internet allows students to ensure they are caught up on their schoolwork and grades, and is therefore extremely helpful.

On the other hand, there are negative aspects of technology as well. Have you ever counted how many times you check your phone per day? Probably not. Have you ever texted someone instead of calling or speaking in person because you were too lazy to do so? Probably yes. We no longer need to go out to obtain information; it is right at our fingertips, quite literally. We do not have to go to libraries anymore to obtain information: we can simply Google it and find exactly what we need. It seems almost more appropriate for schools to teach students how to work with and obtain information rather than how to memorize facts, as the day and age in which we actually had to know information is long gone. An article on Lifehack by Dominique Jackson titled “Has Technology Made us Lazy and Dependent?” discusses all of the things technology provides to us—all of the things that make our world lazier and lazier. There is no longer a need to leave the house for entertainment: we can Google anything, shop online rather than in stores, and even purchase groceries online. We can go to school online, order food online; pretty soon there won’t even be a need to leave the house anymore. Technology, in this sense, makes us lazier.

Technology often leads to a lack of concentration as well. This comes from a variety of different things. There are new apps now that track how many times you open your phone each day. An article by Sarah Perez on TechCrunch quotes Alex Tew, who says using “Checky,” an app that tells you how many times you look at your phone, has opened his eyes. He checks his phone over 100 times a day and now is trying to make a goal to keep it under 100. 100 times is a lot. The fact that there is constantly new news happening, whether on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, news sites, or email, keeps people feeling that they should be checking their phone to stay on top of things. It is also important to take into account the notifications people get on their phones. Texts, emails, weather updates, news updates, calls, tweets, likes on Instagram and Facebook—when your phone buzzes there is often a temptation to check it. This, in a sense, leads to a lack of concentration. If you are bored or tired of what you’re doing, you can simply check your phone or your computer. It’s tempting.

The Internet also opens a range of opportunities for bad things to happen. Cyberbullying, “catfishing,” and releasing too much information to the wrong people all happen online. Anonymous sites like Ask.fm that allow you to post anonymously to people are recipes for cyberbullying. People use Facebook and Twitter to publicly humiliate others via the Internet, hiding behind their screens rather than being direct. “Catfish” is a term that is used to describe someone who fakes being someone else online. This happens everywhere. MTV actually has a show called Catfish, which investigates people who are in online relationships with people they do not know. Sadly, when they finally obtain enough information to contact the Catfish and actually meet up with them, they are frequently not who they said they were. This is terrifying. These people cannot be trusted, and if your information gets into the wrong hands it could be publicly released online for all to see.

Social media can be grueling. Seeing posts from something you were not invited to, seeing all of the cool things other people are doing that you aren’t, looking at all of the successes and cool lifestyles going on around you can be rough. An article on DailyMail by Alex Greig focuses on Facebook and its ability to “undermine well-being and increase loneliness.” The article cites a study by University of Michigan psychologist Ethan Kross. The study texted 82 participants a survey five times a day for two weeks asking them how their social interactions were going, how they felt overall, and what kind of use they were making of Facebook. The study found that the more people used Facebook, the worse they felt about themselves. Looking at Facebook created a feeling of isolation for the people in the study, and made them feel badly about themselves. Social media is definitely capable of having this impact, and making people feel badly about their lives. In general, it also decreases face-to-face and voice-to-voice interactions. Whereas once you may have had to call someone or go speak in person to communicate, you can now shoot a text, Facebook message, Twitter DM, or email. This has led to less and less need for interaction in person. If technology continues to develop the way it is going now, in ten years we won’t ever have to leave the house or speak in person to anyone.

Technology has a lot to offer, both good and bad. There are many positive assets, as well as negatives. While it is inarguable that technology is a huge part of our society today, there are still some drawbacks and flaws to consider. In general, however, it seems as if the benefits outweigh the negatives. Technology has advanced our society in many ways. Think about it: if technology was removed from our lives, they would be propelled decades backwards. Technology has become essential, whether we like it or not. However, it is important that we recognize both the positives and the negatives of technology in order to further progress as a society.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Although it may not feel like it, spring is indeed coming and it is desperately needed.   Don’t get me wrong, I love snow days and wearing my uggs to school just as much as the next girl, but at this point I would do pretty much anything for a sunny spring day.  With the anticipation of spring’s arrival comes new cutting edge trends in the fashion world.  We can finally say goodbye to our dull and dark clothes, and say hello to our fun and vibrant pieces (which have been hibernating deep in our closets during this unbearable winter).  In honor of the arrival of this warm weather, here are some simple items you can add to your outfits to immediately spice up your spring look!

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

Firstly, let’s talk about Graphic Tees:

Although we’ve seen these season after season, somehow they always find new ways to adapt to new times and trends.  Whether it be a picture of  Kate Moss, a cool design, or the logo from the college of your dreams, having an image on your shirt makes every outfit more interesting. The graphic design creates a focal point in your outfit that will draw just about anyone’s eyes to it. Flannel shirts have also started to follow this trend- designers have begun printing graphic images on the backs of flannels.  The graphic’s purpose is to add more depth to what would have been a basic outfit. A graphic tee is the perfect item for spring and can be worn with anything from jean shorts to leggings, for a comfy, casual and cute look!

<strong><strong><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-8.33.37-PM.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4169" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-8.33.37-PM-300x143.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-21 at 8.33.37 PM" width="468" height="223" /></a></strong></strong>

Next, fringed bags:

Fringe is HUGE right now- whether it be on shirts or jackets, it is back and bigger than ever. As of late, we see all the major brands designing fringe bags- from Chanel to Rebecca Minkoff- they are everywhere.  Bags in general are a great accessory, but the fringe adds an element of chicness. These bags can make any ordinary outfit exceptional and very posh.  If you’re looking to splurge or save, you can find a fabulous fringe bag that will spice up any spring outfit!

<strong><strong><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-8.34.03-PM.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4170" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-8.34.03-PM-300x190.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-21 at 8.34.03 PM" width="358" height="227" /></a></strong></strong>

Last, but not least, sneakers:

Time to put away your boots and show off your fun spring shoe style.  Slip on sneakers were huge last year and seem to still be pretty prominent in this spring’s shoe displays.  Vince, Steve Madden and Vince Camuto all have this style mastered- with sparkles, or zippers or just plain and simple you can’t go wrong! These sneakers are perfect for any outfit. Whether you are going to school, hanging with friends or just running errands, these comfy shoes will add sporty style to any outfit!

		<title>Pencils of Promise</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

To say that the Friends Academy Pencils of Promise Club has been successful would be a massive understatement. The club, commonly referred to as PoP, is one of many nationwide that are managed under the broader umbrella of the Pencils of Promise organization. Out of the 106 high-school groups in the nation- Friends Academy tops the list, ranking number one for fundraising.

Pencils of Promise is a relatively new organization, which gained momentum countrywide after its creation in 2008 by founder Adam Braun. According to their website, they are a “for-purpose organization that believes every child should have access to quality education.” Currently, they are working on building schools in the developing countries of Laos, Nicaragua, Ghana, and Guatemala. What distinguishes PoP from other charitable organizations, aside from their construction of quality schools, is their commitment to continuing and sustaining the education programs they put into effect: “We don’t just build a school and move on, we monitor and evaluate every project we undertake. Thus far, every school we’ve opened is fully operational and educating students daily.” Friends Academy is proud to play an extremely integral part in this successful movement.

Just this past year alone, the club fundraised a whopping $25,000—making it the first Pencils of Promise school club to raise enough money to build their own school. The money raised was used not only for construction, but also for training new teachers to work at the new school. With the help of the community, FA was able to build three classrooms for the Awuyakope Preschool located in the Volta region of eastern Ghana, which is one of Ghana’s ten administrative regions.

Students at Friends Academy are almost certainly aware of the numerous fundraisers held by the Pencils of Promise club. Although there are group fundraisers that include all club members, such as car washes, most funds are derived from the individual efforts of club members, such as the most recent event at <em>Bounce! Trampoline Sports</em>. Members must each fulfill a requirement to fundraise $250 in a creative, interesting way. For example, many members have held bake sales in the Atrium during first and second lunches. Sophomore Caroline Wilson held her own sale on April 2<sup>nd</sup> to raise money for Pencils of Promise. “My individual fundraiser was the Cinnamon Bun Waffle Sale which I did with Lily Droesch and Kelsey McEvoy. We raised about $320 and hope to do more sales in the future.” In the past, members have even been known to run marathons or hold popular SoulCycle rides in order to raise money. According to senior club leader Devon McCann (’15), “what really makes this approach successful… is the support from everyone in the club for each person's fundraiser.”

Perhaps the club’s most well known group event is their PoP Winter Formal, which seems to have become a school tradition. This year marked the second annual Formal- on January 29<sup>th</sup>. The entire student body was encouraged to attend. Entry into the dance was for a suggested donation of $30. In terms of the expenses of the dance itself, an anonymous donor has graciously covered the costs of decorating for the past two years, allowing the club to focus on more administrative aspects of the dance, creating a memorable night for the student body, and also promoting Pencils of Promise’s amongst the community. Devon McCann describes the long but worthwhile process in preparing for the event:

“Planning the Winter Formal was not necessarily an easy feat. We [the club] had to jump through a lot of hoops to get approval and permission from several different sections of the school/administration. As far as planning the details, we made sure that all the members participated. Everyone made their opinions and ideas clear in the meetings and each person brought a dessert to the dance.”

Thanks to the extremely hard work and determination of the Pencils of Promise team, the school was able to enjoy a night of fun while also helping a charitable cause.

Through a committed membership and a high enthusiasm in implementing a wide range of fundraisers, the Friends Academy Pencils of Promise club has produced outstanding results. It has earned the distinction of being the top ranked team out of the entire organization, as well as of being the first school team in the nation to single- handedly raise $25,000 for an entire construction. Now that they have built the Awuyakope Preschool in Ghana, the club will continue raising money for more schools. Devon McCann also stated that they will try to “bring more attention to the global education crisis in general.”

As a community, we should encourage each other to get more involved in this particular cause in any way we can, if not any other philanthropic organization. After all, education is one of the Friends Academy community’s highest values, as a school extremely dedicated to academics. When asked why he joined the club, sophomore member Joseph Como stated: “I think education is the key... And it is crucial for everybody around the world to have the opportunity to be educated.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

   With the arrival of May, it seems that more and more of us are coming down with "spring fever".  Urban dictionary defines spring fever as "the want to be outside every day all day rather than doing anything else."  As most of us have noticed, it is becoming a challenge to dress comfortably for the weather, while also following the regulations of the FA dress code.  Although we are advised to keep our Quaker morals in mind while getting dressed every morning, it is a daily challenge to dress in clothes that satisfy both the code and the heat.  Whether it be for comfort, for fashion, or for anything else, it is very hard to stay in code. After asking a number of my fellow classmates I discovered that 4 out of 10 junior girls do not even thinking about dress code while getting dressed in the morning. One female student explains, “It’s hard enough getting up everyday knowing all the work I have ahead of me, trying to pick out a cute outfit that is in code just isn’t at the top of my to do list for everyday”. 
      But what about abiding to the Quaker morals? 7 our of 10 of those same junior girls confess that at this point of the year, they don’t even care about getting in trouble anymore, what is important is their studies and that one DP won’t make or break their scholastic career. So the question at hand is, how can we make out dress code simple enough to follow, while still remaining within the Quaker definition of modesty? Boys are having a particularly hard time this spring sticking to code. Many agree that the code is biased to girls, since they have a lot more flexibility and can seemingly get away with a greater deviation from the code. One sophomore boy said, “How is it fair that a girl can get away with wearing a t-shirt, jeans and a sweater but if I forget to wear a belt, I get in trouble?"
     In my opinion, we need to focus on creating a dress code that is fair for both girls and boys while still respecting Quaker values. This is easier said then done. Similar to what the sophomore boy stated earlier, it seems unfair that a girl can wear a skirt or dress but a boy must wear pants during the harsh heat of June. As a concerned student, I constantly question how to reinforce dress code or how to make it fairer. The answer, I can’t seem to find. It is a hard issue to take on alone.
      A teacher, who has requested to keep their name private, admitted to not even knowing what dress code is anymore. They were asked to elaborate on this statement and responded by saying, “I’m not sure why the girls have decided that the collared shirt rule does not apply to them anymore, I can't say that I necessarily agree that a collard shirt is more modest then a t-shirt, but I don’t know what happened and why it is now somehow ok for girls to wear whatever they want”. An important point made in this quote is modesty. Is it more modest to wear a t-shirt rather than a button down? For many the answer is yes, but is this even in code?
       For the past school year there have been many questions from students and faculty alike about the code- many of which have been stated above. T Although confusion over what exactly the dress code allows is a major problem students are facing, its not the only one surrounding dress code. For this dress code to thrive in this community, students need to respect what is allowed- but they also need to be able to be comfortable in what they are wearing everyday. My advice, ask! The best way to avoid confusion is to get an answer, clarify what is ok and what is not, and let your voice be heard. Stand up for what you think is right regarding this issue, the worst thing that can happen is someone disagrees with you. So, enjoy the weather, enjoy May and enjoy dress code and make the best out of it.]]></content:encoded>

I recently sat down with outgoing sophomore, Kaitlyn Hardy, to learn about her past, current, and future career as a dancer.  Kaitlyn gave me a brief history of her dance career up to now, her passion beginning when she was just two years old. She began dancing at Dance Theater of Harlem studio and later moved to Alvin Ailey. In the past, Kaitlyn has participated in many different competitions nationwide, in addition to performing for several sports teams, including the Philadelphia 76ers, the New York Knicks, and the Brooklyn Nets. Moving her basic history, Kaitlyn gave me an insight on the core of her career; heres a snip of our interview:

Lizzy: How did you discover your passion for dance?

Kaitlyn: I do not remember dancing when I was younger than three as my mom took me to dance.  I really started developing my passion when I was five or six years old.

Lizzy: What is your favorite style of dance?

Kaitlyn: I like hip-hop and contemporary.

Lizzy: Is there any history of dancing in you family? (If so has that inspired you or played a role in your career?)

Kaitlyn:  Yes.  My moms third cousin, Bill Bailey, was a famous tap dancer.  Bill Bailey’s sister, Pearl Bailey, is a famous singer and dancer, who passed before I was born. This history influenced me to work harder.  I did not know about this side of the family till three years ago, but since then it has pushed me to work harder.

Lizzy: What do you see in your future with dance?

Kaitlyn:  I want to go to college in California so that I can pursue my dance career on the West Coast because I have an agent on the West Coast and New York, but I have not done any dance jobs out there, which I hope to do in the future.  I would also love to be in commercials, along with tour… a world tour would be nice!

Lizzy: How has danced played a role in your life (outside the studio)?

Kaitlyn: It's nice. I dance a lot with my friends everywhere [outside of the studio].  It's a good way to express ourself without speaking.  It's also an easier way to express ourselves.

Lizzy: If there was one person you could dance with who would it be and why?

Kaitlyn: Michael Jackson.  He is the bomb! I would also love to dance with Beyonce.  What truly inspires me the most about her is the fact that she was pregnant, yet still capable to move the way she did.

Lizzy: Who is someone you look up to in the dance world? Why?

Kaitlyn: I look up to Jose Tena.  He is now on tour with Ariana Grande.  He is an older brother to me, and we used to dance together everyday.  Because of our connection, and to see his success, its truly inspiring.

Lizzy: Thank you Kaitlyn. It was an absolute pleasure having the opportunity to learn about your fascinating career and future as a dancer.]]></content:encoded>

Every summer is documented by an anthem or "summer jam". Within seconds of the song being played, this anthem will bring back memories from any given year. In 2012, the "summer jam" was Carly Rae Jepsen's debut hit, "Call me Maybe".  We can remember moments from the summer of 2013 by just hearing Robin Thicke repeat, "Hey Hey Hey" from his hit single, "Blurred Lines".  Last summer's memories can be described by Pharell in one word, "Happy". So what songs will define the summer of 2015?

Here are 10 songs that will guarantee good memories and sponsor nostalgia when hearing them in those sad moments once summer is over!

<ol>
	<li>Hold My Hand- Jess Glynne</li>
</ol>   2.Lean On- Major Lazer (feat. Mo &amp; DJ Snake)
<ol start="3"> 
        <li>This Summer's Gonna Hurt Like A...- Maroon 5</li>
	<li>I Really Like You- Carly Rae Jepsen</li>

		<title>Mango Avocado Yogurt Dip Offers a Taste of Summer</title>

Summer vacation is around the corner, and with summer comes a new and exciting palate of flavors in the kitchen. Arriving home after a long, tiring week of of school on a Friday afternoon means two things- happiness and hunger. After rummaging through the cabinets and the fridge, I decided to try out a new recipe for Mango Avocado Yogurt Dip. This snack is not only healthy and delicious, but also incredibly simple. So, if you are feeling adventurous and want to try out something new, here is how you can make it:

Ingredients:
1 cup of plain Greek yogurt
1 whole mango (or pre-sliced mango)
1 whole avocado
1 jalapeño pepper (this is optional, it adds a little spice)
1 lime
A drizzle of olive oil
1/2-1 Tbsp salt
A sprinkle of pepper
1 bag of corn chips

First, scoop the yogurt into a bowl and spread it evenly across the bottom, so it is somewhat flat. Next, slice up the mango and avocado into cubes, and spread these cubes over the yogurt. Then take the jalapeño and slice it up into the smallest pieces possible, you probably would not want to end up biting down on a large chunk of this. Slice your lime in half and squeeze the juice over the bowl. Add a drizzle of olive oil over the surface of your dip. Finally, sprinkle your salt and pepper over the bowl.

All there is left to do is grab your bag of chips, kick your feet up, and enjoy.

Here is a short video demonstration:

At Friends, there seems to be a certain academic and social silence surrounding sensitive topics. One such topic is sexual orientation. I have spoken to only a select group of Friends students who were open about identifying as non-heterosexual. Yet it is hard for me to believe that there are not more students on our campus unsure of their sexuality, which suggests to me that there may be a perceived risk among students about the consequences of voicing their orientation. Interestingly, the Friends community has a relatively progressive student body and faculty, especially when it comes to social issues. The Gay Straight Alliance was even resurrected this year by Sachi Dulai and Julia Vascatto. Still, as far as the student body knows, the faculty members, who serve as role models for the students, are all heterosexual. There remains a lack of discussion on the topic of sexual orientation in the classroom. Way too often I hear jokes or offensive comments made by my peers at the expense of the LGBTQ community. I wondered what it must feel like to sit in a classroom, unsure of your own sexual orientation, and hear these comments. The more I thought about this topic, the more I wondered what it is really like to come out at Friends Academy, a community where conversation about sexual orientation rarely occurs. So I asked my good friend Ryan Dobrin, Friends Academy Alumnus (Class of 2014), to sit down with me to talk about his experience coming out during his junior year of high school.

Olivia: When did you realize your sexual orientation?

Ryan: I have to admit, I was a little late in realizing I was gay. It took me until around ninth grade to realize I liked guys, and for the entirety of my freshman year, I thought I was bisexual. I even came out to a few of my friends. It wasn’t until tenth grade that, through talking with my friends and coming to terms with who my crushes were and how I felt about them, that I realized the feelings I had for girls were very different from the ones I had for guys.

Olivia: Did you feel that you could come out to the FA community, why or why not?

Ryan: I’m very fortunate to have been a gay teenager at Friends. I did feel that I could come out, mostly because I knew queer students in the grades above me, and, as far as I could tell, they had no trouble being open about themselves. I reached a point my junior year where I wanted to be open, but I truly hated one-on-one “I need to talk to you about something” conversations, and I wanted to have everyone know and to have it be public knowledge without me worrying about who I’ve told or who I still needed to tell. However, despite the apparent positivity of the Friends community, there still were risks to coming out. You never know how a friend might react. I was especially worried about my more religious friends and my friends who were more conservative, for their potential reactions. Ultimately, they were nothing but positive and supportive. I was also very worried about my male friends. For whatever reason, I was worried that my relationship with them would be weird, or they would just be creeped out. Again, my coming out did nothing but strengthen my relationships with my male friends. However, I did hear gay jokes at least once a week, and many students in high school (male and female) make fun of or joke about gay relationships. They were certainly not doing it out of a place of malice, but it definitely did not feel good, as a closeted teenager, to hear those things and not being able to say anything. One of the worst moments happened my freshman year and probably pushed my coming out back a year. It was the Day of Silence, and the GSA had rainbow pins to wear if you were supporting the day. Although I participated my following three years of high school, I was not silent my freshman year, but still wore the pin in support of those who were. In the commons, a male classmate who I was mildly friendly with stopped me and thanked me for help I gave on the homework. He was about to hug me, and stopped, stating he didn’t want to imply anything because I had the “gay pin” on.

Olivia: What was the response like when you came out to the community? Did this surprise you? Why or why not?

Ryan: On October 11, 2012 (National Coming Out Day), I posted a coming out status on Facebook on a whim. The response was overwhelmingly positive. It ultimately got 167 likes, and over 30 supportive comments from friends. My next day in school was filled with many hugs and a surprising number of “hello’s” in the hallway, and my life reverted back to normal in the next couple of days. I wasn’t expecting negative results, especially because I’ve seen other gay students navigate life at Friends with ease, but again, you can never be sure. Coming out gave me a lot of confidence I didn’t have before. I spoke up more in class, I made many more friends, and I found myself voicing my opinion more. It especially gave me confidence in doing what I love, performing. I made many more friends in the Theater Department, which made rehearsals and working on side projects that much more fun and rewarding. Those relationships are the ones that keep me coming back to Friends to see the shows. Coming out also gave me the power to say something whenever someone said something ignorant about LGBTQ people or issues. For instance, a few months after coming out, I was asked to prom by one of my very close male friends. Later that same month, someone in one of my classes was talking to his friend before the lesson began about whether the school would allow a same-sex couple at prom. I don’t believe he was expecting me to respond and say that there would, in fact, be a same-sex couple at prom that year, and I would be one of them. Additionally, I found myself standing up against offensive comments. People don’t think about the damage these statements could cause. A not incredibly offensive comment pushed me back into the closet for another year. I can’t even imagine the irreparable damage one must feel hearing their friend say something negative or offensive about LGBTQ people, and being in the closet themselves. I found the statement “that is offensive, and you shouldn’t say it anymore” worked best, and as soon as the person realized that I am gay, they suddenly are sorry. I must pose the question – if you’re sorry once you realized you said it in front of a gay person, shouldn’t you not say it at all?

Olivia: What could the Friends community do better to be more welcoming to those who identify as LGBTQ?

Ryan: Education is key. I simply think there isn’t enough conversation about sexual minorities. The GSA was struggling throughout my time in high school, and didn’t even exist my senior year. I applaud the efforts of Julia and Sachi for starting the club again this year, but they cannot be the only ones talking about this. Sex Ed needs to discuss non-heterosexual relationships. There needs to talk about what is offensive and what is not. There needs to be talk about how to be supportive and what to do if one is questioning their own sexuality or gender. And while the main two of LGBTQ (gay and lesbian) are the most common, there needs to be discussion on people who are transgender, gender fluid, bisexual, pansexual, and the countless other sexual minorities that exist but aren’t viewed as valid or legitimate by many people. Conversation needs to exist to educate, and from that education, people will be more comfortable to come out in this environment.

I had an incredible time being openly gay at Friends. I made many more friends and was able to truly embrace the things I loved, simply because I wasn’t hiding a major part of who I am. Friends is truly a wonderful place to be open about your sexuality. There just needs some work in order to get everybody on the same page.

A big thank you to Ryan Dobrin for being so open with me. I hope this encourages other people, students and faculty alike, to share their stories and start discussing this issue. It is only fair that every student should feel safe and comfortable being who they are in the community they rely on for guidance and support during the formative time of adolescence.]]></content:encoded>

We all know YouTube as that website you go to to watch Beyoncé’s latest music video or a forty-five minute compilation of cat fails, but since it’s beginning in 2005, the video sharing website has exploded into so much more. There are currently 1,311 YouTube channels that have over one million subscribers- the channel most subscribed to has 36 million subscribers. As an avid YouTube user and video creator since 2009, I have seen so much change in this online community and its expansion into the mainstream media. For example, Grace Helbig, has become one of the most successful YouTubers, not for having nearly 40 million subscribers, but also because of how she has started bringing YouTube-like content to mainstream television across the globe.

&nbsp;

Current thirty year old, Grace Helbig, started making YouTube videos in 2008 and since then has only excelled in her entertainment career path. Just this year she created and starred in a comedy talk show titled, <i>The Grace Helbig Show</i>, which was quickly picked up by <i>E!</i> network. The show aired in April of 2015. She is the first YouTuber to have her own network television show. Hopefully her show will probably open the doors to other Youtubers to do the same. Her show is, “a hybrid comedy show that features the comedienne’s fresh take on what's trending in pop culture, as well as exclusive interviews with various celebrity guests” (<i>eonline.com). </i>I have found that adults who most commonly tune into <i>E!</i>’s late night shows are confused by the “YouTube vlogger” format of the show and find it somewhat childish and unintended for them. There is also the factor of her online comedic success coming from the enjoyment from younger audiences who don’t have the same sense of humor or relatable topics in social culture. <i>E!</i>  was clearly aware of the younger (13-18) audience they would gain from Helbig’s 2,500,000 subscriber base and tried to use that as a way to pull in more viewers, but with the show having a 10:30 EST time slot, most kids don’t tune in. 

Personally I have no urge to watch the show because of the already high level of accessibility of her content from her YouTube channel. In my opinion, although show has not gathered a large flock of viewers, the network made a risky and smart decision by being the first to sign a YouTuber to a show because of how popular, accessible, and enjoyable the online, Youtube culture has become.

&nbsp;

In conclusion, YouTube has opened up incredible opportunities throughout the entertainment world. I think that the joining of platforms (Youtube and TV) will definitely take a while to settle as a “community norm” to this generation of adults, but in the long run it will become a really fun, accepted and collaborative effort. Many people have started to watch YouTube more than T.V.. I think that more people will start to join this trend as the online, entertainment industry progresses.]]></content:encoded>

Walking through the school hallways on my way to lunch, I caught bits and pieces of a conversation among a crowd of highly energetic boys, who were talking about some fight that was happening on Saturday. I heard someone say something about “a hundred bucks” and thought that possibly someone was having a fight over some money. I continued to wonder what they were talking about; little did I know that I would soon be surrounded by frequent chatter about the boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in the upcoming days. They weren’t fighting over one hundred dollars; instead, the prize was about 300 million. The hundred dollars was simply the cost to order and watch the fight on TV; people were willing to pay that much just to watch some guys punch each other. The days preceding the highly anticipated boxing match between undefeated champion Mayweather and Pacquiao were filled with excitement among fans and even casual followers of the sport, who were eager to tune into the fight. It was anticipated to be one of the greatest fights of all time; many were calling it “The Fight of the Century,” and no one wanted to miss it. Even as someone who knows absolutely nothing about boxing, I became interested in hearing about  the outcome.

In the end, Floyd Mayweather was the winner, beating Pacquiao 14 to 0. I did not watch any of the fight, but wanted to know who won. As I often do in order to find out information, I looked up “Mayweather Pacquiao” on Twitter to find out the results. My search lead me to the discovery that Floyd Mayweather was the ultimate champion. Mayweather was praised and idolized by many for his achievement and won $4,994,681 per minute of the fight. However, many were angered by the match, stating that it was boring and lacking in action. That did not matter to Mayweather, though, because he was the winner and a very, very rich man.

As I scrolled deeper through the tweets out of boredom, a picture caught my eye with the caption “Floyd Mayweather's son's police report.” As soon as I opened it, I realized I had discovered an interesting yet extremely disturbing thing in my search: a picture of Mayweather’s son’s statement to police about his father’s abuse towards his mother.

The report reads:

“I saw my dad was on my mom and my mom said go to the [office] my dad was [hitting] her and when my dad left he took my phone and his friend was blocking the stairs. His [friend’s] name is James and my dad [kicked] my mom and he told me to go in my room but I went to go get my mom’s friend that [lives] in our back house. My dad knocked on my door to the family patio then I [opened] it and he came in and told me to close the door to the family room. Then I heard yelling and I came out and my dad was [hitting] my mom. It [happened] at 4:00 am in the morning. Then my mom told me to run to the gate. Then I can and James was walking to come and get me. So then I jumped the fence and went to the [security] [office] and told them then I heard my mom [running] to the gate then the [security] let her in. Then [James] got in my [dad’s] car and drove to the other gate. His car is a [maybach]. When all this started my mom was asleep on the couch in the [family] room. My dad took my [mom’s] phone.”

As I read through this report, I was flooded with a mix of emotions. How could Mayweather do this to his own wife? How could he allow his child to witness such a horrific act? How has he been allowed to participate in a professional sports league and why haven’t his violent tendencies received mainstream attention? Why are people supporting such a terrible man? This lead to me delve deeper into Mayweather’s history of domestic violence and what I found was a man with a troubled past.

With a history of domestic abuse that begins in 2002, Floyd Mayweather has been accused of domestic violence about seven times. He was convicted four of those times, pleading guilty twice, and let off on one count because the case was dropped by his ex girlfriend Josie Harris. In 2001 Mayweather got into a fight with the mother of his daughter, Melissia Brim, punching her in the face and body. As reported by NY Daily News in 2002, Mayweather said at press conference, “Everybody that knows Floyd Mayweather knows I'm a good guy. I have never been to jail.” Considering he has plead guilty twice, there is something extremely disturbing about that statement. Mayweather’s next arrest, in 2003, took place at a Las Vegas nightclub where he punched two women. In 2005, he was arrested for beating a bouncer at a Michigan bar, as well as beating his ex Josie Harris, who later dropped charges against him. Harris would later press the most recent charges against Mayweather in December 2011, an incident that was detailed by their son. Mayweather beat Harris until she was left with bruises and a concussion because she told him that she was dating someone else.

After processing all of information I collected, I sat staring at my computer, stunned and wondering how Floyd Mayweather could possibly be respected by anyone. Is it that people just don’t know he’s a serial batterer? I choose to believe that the majority of the public is uninformed, since the believing the alternative--that people know but don't care--would mean troubling things about our society. It’s scary to think that someone could have turned on that fight and paid for it knowing that they were promoting a face of domestic violence. It’s not like the media was advertising Mayweather's history of domestic abuse: all they cared about was pushing it under the rug so that they could reap in the greatest amount of profit possible.]]></content:encoded>

Over time, body acceptance activists protested and raged about the harm of the classic Barbie doll. Mattel, an American toy manufacturer, launched Barbie for the first time in 1959. Since then Mattel has been primarily associated with the doll. After being blamed for the increase in adolescent eating disorders, Mattel has attracted hate from a new audience.

In the past couple of years, due to the rise of electronic devices, there has been an alarming drop in Barbie doll sales. Out of fear of losing popularity permanently, the toy company has decided to incorporate ever evolving technology with the traditional Barbie doll. This new doll has been named Hello Barbie.

Hello Barbie has attracted attention from parents and children’s privacy activists around the world. The concerns are valid and raise the question of whether this new doll should be sold.

At a recent New York toy fair, a Mattel representative introduced the newest version of Barbie by saying: "Welcome to New York, Barbie."

Hello Barbie then responded with: "I love New York! Don't you? Tell me, what's your favorite part about the city? The food, fashion, or the sights?"

Mattel is bringing Barbie to life with new voice-recognition software that will allow the doll to "listen" to children speak and give chatty responses. The doll will also remember things about each child, such as their dog's name or their favorite food. Based on the information given, Hello Barbie will adjust its response to fit the child’s personality and tastes. This means Hello Barbie will incorporate the child’s specific likes and dislikes in every response.

The new Wifi- connected Barbie may become a hit among the new generation of technology-obsessed children, but privacy advocates are demanding production cease immediately. Why are they so against it? They say it could be used to spy on children.

Susan Linn, executive director of the nonprofit Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC), which began a campaign to pull Mattel’s product from the shelves earlier this year, says: “They really shouldn’t call it ‘Hello Barbie’; they should call it Surveillance Barbie.” Other privacy advocates simply refer to the doll as “creepy”.

Mattel says the doll's voice-recognition technology allows it have a "unique relationship" with its owner. Similarly, a Mattel representative said, “Barbie will become [the child's] new best friend.” With a doll that now has the ability to listen to any child and produce specific, unique responses, the possibility of the doll becoming the girl's “best friend” isn't far off. However, one must think about the health effects if such a thing were to happen. Is it productive for children (or anyone) to have a close relationship with an inanimate object? Will this doll negatively impact children’s social skills?

Advocates from the Campaign for a Commercial-free Childhood (CCFC) say the new technology could be exploited. A <a href="http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/child-advocates-mobilize-stop-mattels-eavesdropping-hello-barbie">statement</a> from the CCFC claims: "In Mattel's demo, Barbie asks many questions that would elicit a great deal of information about a child, her interests, and her family. This information could be of great value to advertisers and used to market unfairly to children."

The speech-recognition technology in Hello Barbie was created by San Francisco startup ToyTalk. ToyTalk was founded by a pair of former Pixar employees who have already created a number of paid iOS apps that let children have conversations with a range of creatures, from animals in the zoo to mythical beasts. The necklace on the doll will feature both the microphone and the speaker that help enable the conversations. The necklace is not removable.

ToyTalk’s privacy policy states that it may "use, store, process, and transcribe recordings" in order to "improve speech recognition technology" and carry out "research and development and data analysis." All of the children’s conversations with the new doll will be stored permanently on servers. Angela Campbell, faculty adviser at Georgetown University's Center on Privacy and Technology, said in a statement:  "If I had a young child, I would be very concerned that my child's intimate conversations with her doll were being recorded and analyzed." Their ambitions, likes, dislikes, and personal information will be made public. Susan Linn, the director of the CCFC, has said the doll creates "a host of dangers" for children and families. These risks include skilled computer hackers. "Kids using 'Hello Barbie' aren't only talking to a doll," said Linn, "They are talking directly to a toy conglomerate whose only interest in them is financial." Hello Barbie's new industry moniker--Big Sister--seems all too fitting.

There is always a tradeoff between privacy and functionality - but is a talking Barbie the killer app that will drive parents to offer up their little girls to corporate stalkers? Will “Big Sister” turn out as bad as many fear, or are the concerns exaggerating the situation? We will just have to wait and see when the doll hits shelves this fall.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After an eventful first year in the F.A. community, I caught up with Mrs. Chiarenza to do a Q&amp;A regarding her experiences this past year:

Q: "When you came to Friends, what were you excited and/or nervous about?"

A: "I was really excited about the small school environment. It really wasn't something I was used to before. I think it helps me get to know the students better. I was sort of nervous for the same reason. I guess the expectations on the teachers might be a little higher but I really hope I did a good job."

Q: "What did you do this year to immerse yourself in the F.A. community?"

A: "I actually made that one of my goals to get to know the community better. I made an effort to go to sporting events and the Hello Dolley play. I also attended some of the alternative meetings."

Q: "What is it about the quaker values that you either like or dislike?"

A: "I definitely like the quaker values. I like that there is a higher expectation aside from just doing well academically as well as an increasing emphasis on character."

Q: "What do you look forward to most in your upcoming years at Friends?"

A: "I just look forward to being part of this close-knit and being a member of the F.A. family."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reflections from Departing Teachers</title>

2015 marks the last school year for many Upper School teachers at Friends Academy. Whether leaving for retirement or in pursuit of an opportunity elsewhere, we will surely miss these beloved faculty members. Inkwell interviewed the following teachers regarding their experience here at FA.

<b>Judy James:</b>

The unforgettable, passionate Judy James will be retiring this year after spending twenty-six years at Friends Academy (FA). If you have had her as your tenth grade community service teacher, or have had a chance to just chat with her in the Kumar-Wang library, you probably know that Ms. James has definitely seen it all throughout her career here at FA.
<ol>
	<li>How long have you worked at Friends Academy?</li>
</ol>
<i>I have worked at FA for 25 years.</i>
<ol>
	<li>What is the funniest moment you’ve had here?</li>
</ol>
<i>Funniest moment, while this wasn't that funny at the time is has become my funniest memory.  This was a senior prank: seniors bought cheap cell phones and some how hid them in the ceiling light fixtures in the library.  Then some time later they started calling all the phones they hid!  Needless to stay the rest of the students thought it was hysterical, as I do now.</i>
<ol>
	<li>What is your fondest memory of FA?</li>
</ol>
<i>Lots of fond memories, but the most interesting was taking a group of students </i>

<i>to do service on the Lakota Sioux Indian reservation in South Dakota.</i>
<ol>
	<li>What will you miss most about the school?</li>
</ol>
<i>    </i><i>I will most miss my colleagues.</i>
<ol>
	<li>Any final reflections?</li>
</ol>
You may not know this about Ms. James, but on top of teaching senior English, community service, and building houses for years with Habitat for Humanity, she has also coached crew, and helped with the designing &amp; building one of the most beautiful, admired and well used school libraries!

<b>Camille Edwards:</b>

Camille Edwards has been a source of great advice, hugs and invaluable teaching for the three years she has worked at Friends Academy. Camille's impact on her students is not something that can be put into words, but the artists she has mentored and supported will always remember the effect she has had on their lives.
<ol>
	<li>How long have you worked at FA?</li>
</ol>
<i>3 years.</i>
<ol start="2">
	<li>What is the funniest moment you’ve had here?</li>
</ol>
<i>There isn’t one specific funny moment, but it’s whenever I’m working with Early Childhood. They’re so honest, and they’re so young that they don’t really know what they are saying. Sometimes it’s stuff they’ve heard, or it’s just coming from their own minds, but they’ll just say things that make me crack up. Sometimes it’s what acne is, or what love is. It always catches me off guard, and that makes it even funnier. I truly think they’re 30 years olds in a 4 year olds body.</i>
<ol start="3">
	<li>What is your fondest memory of FA?</li>
</ol>
<i>My first Original Works. It was my first freshman dance class, and I will always remember creating that piece for them. </i>
<ol start="4">
	<li>What will you miss most about the school?</li>
</ol>
<i>I think what I will miss most about this school is getting work in an environment where the children feel safe, to be themselves, to experiment, to make friends. I think that’s something that is inherent in a Quaker school, that everyone feels safe to be themselves and to explore things. And really following that, the arts are a value here. It’s just such a prevalent part of the community- this school is rich in the arts. Not only is it accepted to be in the arts, but it’s normal to be a kid who loves the arts. It’s really a gift to get to teach at this kind of school, where we can create magic.</i>
<ol start="5">
	<li>Any final reflections?</li>
</ol>
<i>Life is funny because you never know what your next chapter holds, where your life is going to go. I never thought I would teach at FA- I had planned to go to grad school right after college, but I walked in as a leave replacement three years ago and just ended up staying. I feel grateful because I almost feel like I cheated the universe. I got to be an artist in a community I love, which was the ultimate gift- getting to do something I didn’t think I would get to. And now I’m back on the path I had originally set out for myself, and this field is the opposite of what I’ve been doing at Friends, so I’ve gotten to have the best of the both worlds.</i>

<b>Alec Lash:</b>

Alec Lash, also commonly known amongst his students as “DJ Whiplash”, will be leaving the FA community next year for an opportunity in Florida. As a teacher who demonstrates a tremendous interest in really connecting with his students on a personal level and making the math classroom environment fun for all, his presence will be greatly missed.
<ol>
	<li>How long have you worked at FA?</li>
</ol>
<i>I have been at FA for the past 6 years.</i>
<ol>
	<li>What was the funniest moment you’ve had here?</li>
</ol>
<i>My Friends Academy journey has been full of far too many funny moments to choose one to share, but I will give a special shout to Christos Aniftos, class of 2015, for being the funniest student I have ever known, and I will share one quick "I can't believe this just happened" classroom anecdote:  Several years ago, I gave a short one question quiz to one of my classes.  After 5 minutes, when I thought that everyone was finished, I asked the class, "Is everyone finished?  Do I have all the quizzes?"  It was simple question.  I repeated it twice.  Typically, my students have no problem speaking up when they are still working.  On this particular occasion, I noticed a few affirmative nods of the head, and received a silent, understood agreement that everyone was ready to move on.  I continued with class by spending the next 5 minutes explaining the solution to the quiz.  Immediately after I finished, a student walked up to the front of the class and handed me his quiz.  While his quiz was 100% correct, it quickly landed in the trash bin!  Even after explaining the situation to him, he was incredulous, and couldn't understand why I wasn't accepting his quiz!</i>
<ol>
	<li>What is your fondest memory of FA?</li>
</ol>
<i>It is difficult to single out my fondest memory.  Instead, I like to reminisce about a collection of memories including Math Department "Galas" and "Dress Up Days", Spirit Weeks, Halloween assemblies, hanging out with my advisories and the unexpected, spontaneous, and sometimes minor details of classroom experiences that create lasting shared memories for an entire class to cherish. </i>
<ol>
	<li>What will you miss most about the school?</li>
</ol>
<i>I will miss the campus, Meeting for Worship, and my morning "commute", but most of all I'm going to miss the people that make up the FA community.  I've been so lucky to have great colleagues and incredible mentors turn into close friends.  Perhaps, most of all, I'm going to miss the student body.  I've been blessed with extraordinary classes and advisories over the past 6 years, and it saddens me to think about returning students who I will not be able working with in the future.</i>

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><i>Any final reflections about working at the school?<i>
</i></i></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<i>Although I am excited to embark on a new stage in my life, I am leaving FA with a heavy heart.  I will miss the strong sense of community here.  I wish best of luck to my colleagues and all the students in their future endeavors!</i>

<b>Kate Scudellari:</b>

Kate Scudellari has been both an enthusiastic, motivating Spanish teacher and advisor to the Model UN Club, supporting both new and veteran members, during her time at Friends Academy. Although the community is sad to see Mrs. Scudellari go, we are grateful that she has given so much of herself to this school and the people here.
<ol>
	<li>How long have you worked at Friends Academy?</li>
</ol>
<i>5 years.</i>
<ol start="2">
	<li><i> What is your fondest memory of FA?</i></li>
</ol>
Anytime I watched students work on projects in my classroom. Getting to see students lead and show their creative sides made me feel proud of them as a teacher, and it was one of the most enjoyable parts of my job as a Spanish teacher.
<ol start="3">
	<li><i> What will you miss most about the school?</i></li>
</ol>
I’ll miss the people- the students, my colleagues. The people at Friends are of such high quality, students and adults alike, and I will miss working with them.
<ol start="4">
	<li><i> What was the funniest moment you’ve had here?</i></li>
</ol>
I was watching a presentation by Merek Glover and Harrison Fritz, where they had to present a Spanish menu. Harrison talked for about 30 seconds, and did well, and then Merek went. He spoke for four minutes, and the entire class was laughing- as was I- just because he kept going!
<ol start="5">
	<li><i> Any final reflections about working at the school?</i></li>
</ol>
I’ve found that as much as I’ve been a teacher, I’ve also been taught by the students. I’m most grateful for having these direction connections with my students, where both of us are learning from each other. It’s really about working with the heart. Its an amazing experience, working that way, and I don’t think I would be as qualified to begin my new job without the experience I have had here at Friends Academy.]]></content:encoded>

As the school year is quickly coming to an end, we celebrate many graduates outstanding artwork at the AP art show, which is now on display.  This gallery features brilliant photographs, superb drawings, and even an original clothing line.  Each artist had her own approach on this creative assignment, making each project unique and innovative.   One artist,  Julianne Florez, created an authentic summer brand, “Oasis”, which features bathing suits and shoes.  Julianne created original prints, which she then printed onto her brand, giving each item a different twist.  Oasis is bright and playful, creating a new outlook on art, along with adding a distinctive aspect to the gallery. Riley Denihan’s display takes a different approach.  Her photographs demonstrate the natural elements of earth, including images of water and fields.  In addition, Riley designed a 3D fish, using different materials including wire, copper, silver, cardboard, and epoxy. 

Contrasting Riley's natural ideas are the art pieces Elana Pinto which, “focused on the physical layering and weaving of digital images”, as said in her description.  Elana used Photoshop and other softwares, to help generate her photographs, which she then weaved by hand.  Much of Elana’s art highlights similar themes, including the human body.  Elana comments, “When working to digitally manipulate photos I get results immediately, but what I enjoyed about weaving the physical versions of my photos was being able to see the end result being slowly created as I weaved”.  One can clearly see the vast amount of time put into this display, along with the hard work projected by each artist.  

The 2015 AP art show, takes a different approach on art, exemplifying various styles and techniques on ones artwork.  The gallery is overall extremely compelling, I highly recommend that you stop by the gallery and see it! ]]></content:encoded>

There is no denying the fact that the NHL Playoff craze has taken over FA. It all began in April
when the New York Islanders and the New York Rangers qualified for the playoffs. The
Islanders faced the Washington Capitals in the first round, but came up short against
Ovechkin and the Caps. Throughout the Rangers' run for the cup, the Friends Academy
Islander fans have continuously shown their dedication to their team: rooting for their former
opponents, the Capitals, and then the Rangers final opponents, Tampa Bay Lightning.

The playoffs have created a whirlwind of “chirping” in the FA community. Walking through the
third floor hallway in the high school on the day of Game 7 for the Rangers, you can hear the
conversations between Islander and Ranger fans. Rivalry talk has even entered morning meetings
when students announce the progress of their teams and game times. Since the Islanders
made the playoffs, surprisingly for the second year in a row, Islander fans can’t stop their
tongues. FA has become somewhat short of a “gongshow” during the playoffs: team
dedications and emotions are high, creating the NHL craze.

Although it seems that the playoffs are creating a tide in our community, it is truly unifying it.
With the communication between fans of either teams, the Rangers and Islanders, new
friendships have been made. During this run for the cup, I have enjoyed the chirps, the laughs
and short outbursts of aggression towards Islander fans. Through the talks and chirps I have
had meaningful conversations with teachers and become friends with kids I never really talked
to earlier. We may not see eye ­to ­eye but at the end of the day we’re all good ole’ hockey
fans.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Getting to Know Dr. Howard</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prior to joining the community at FA, Doc Howard taught at Rutgers University and Franklin &amp; Marshall College, where she was a Visiting Assistant Professor. She completed her dissertation at Rutgers in 2013, and has been the recipient of awards and fellowships from the McNeil Center for Early American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, the Huntington Library, the Harrison Institute at the University of Virginia, and Rutgers University. Her scholarly work has been published in the journals <i>American Literature</i> and <i>Common-place</i>. I decided to ask Doc Howard a few questions after her first year teaching at Friends.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. What is your favorite thing about Friends Academy?</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>The students! Kids here are bright and curious, and I have had a great time teaching old material in a new context. I am surprised every day by my students&mdash;their zaniness, their hope, their willingness to think something for the first time. On rainy Mondays or days that would otherwise drag, my students are the first to cheer me up. Maybe that sounds cheesy, but if you&rsquo;re in my classroom you know it&rsquo;s true!</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Who was your first friend at FA? (teacher or student)</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>I was lucky enough to meet Doc Garrett in my initial interview, and we&rsquo;ve continued to be close to this day. English can be a really fun discipline if you are fortunate enough to work with someone with her sense of wit. I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention Profe Scudelari or Ms. Levey as well, two friends I bonded with right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3. Considering your disclosed views on gender equality, what is your view on our school&#39;s dress code?&nbsp;(Since you are a new teacher, I understand that it might be controversial to answer questions like this, but you have actually shed light on issues surrounding dress code when other teachers have failed to do so).</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>This is a very interesting question, which I will address from two different angles. The first takes up the issue of etymology. Many students suspect that the term &ldquo;modesty&rdquo; may have a meaning that has applied differently to men and women throughout the history of its usage. The Oxford English Dictionary dates the earliest use of the term to mean &ldquo;decorum, propriety; scrupulous sobriety of thought, speech, conduct, etc,; natural avoidance of coarseness or lewdness&rdquo; to 1531. Though this meaning has remained in circulation, the OED notes that its earliest use pertained to &ldquo;virtue proper to women.&rdquo; This means that the word &ldquo;modesty&rdquo; carries with it a gendered linguistic history. Can a word with this type of history apply to men and women equally?</p>

	<p>One suggestion I have made throughout the year is thinking about the term &ldquo;professional&rdquo; as a potential substitute for &ldquo;modesty&rdquo;. Most workplaces have a professional dress code, and while work clothing may differ for men and women, the term itself applies to (and implies) them equally.</p>

	<p>Another concern students have raised with me this year, beyond questioning the term &ldquo;modesty,&rdquo; is the role dress code plays in a world where gender is increasingly recognized as a fluid category. Does it make sense to impose gender categories on individuals who might be questioning their own gender identification or pushing back against a system that dictates what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; means for men and women? Whether it is something as major as Caitlyn Jenner&rsquo;s transition, or as minor as tailors creating suiting for genderqueer/fluid professional women, signs abound that awareness in our society is growing around issues of gender and identification. This is truly an exciting moment in our history, and it is personally inspiring to me that students here are interested in thinking more about these issues in general, and dress code in particular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4. Do students at Friends disprove or approve of the stereotypes you might have heard about them prior to joining our community? (I.e. aloof, spoiled, snobbish)</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>My sense is that they strongly disapprove of these stereotypes. FA students want to be seen as whole individuals. In my experience, it is wise to reserve judgments about groups. It&rsquo;s far better to get to know people as individuals, and to recognize that there is always room for a conversation and learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5. After your first year here, do you feel as if Friends is the right fit for you? If so, why?</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Taking this job was really a leap into the dark for me, and I&rsquo;m happy to say that it has paid off. Given my experience as a teacher at the college level, I thought I would be successful in making this transition, but nothing could have prepared me for the warm reception I received from students here. I have made a point of thanking my students for their willingness to adapt with me as I adjust to a new teaching environment. It is this level of generosity and enthusiasm on the part of the student body that has confirmed to me that this transition was truly the right thing.</p>
</blockquote>

		<title>The GSS Germany Peace Project</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As countries, the United States and Germany have had a complicated relationship since the end of World War I, when the Allies used their victory over Germany to impose the Treaty of Versailles, crushing the country economically, politically and socially. People from both nations bear the scars of an ongoing struggle to understand and come to terms with the past, while somehow finding a way to move forward. For the older generation, it&rsquo;s difficult. Our grandparents can remember the horrors of World War II vividly. My grandmother often shares stories of how she had to evacuate London, leaving her parents and going to live with strangers for the majority of the war. For the younger generation- our generation- it&rsquo;s different. We don&rsquo;t have memories of rations, air raid alerts, or receiving news that a loved one was killed in action. Unlike our parents who lived in the era of the Berlin Wall, we didn&rsquo;t experience what it was like to witness or live in a country that was divided. What we do have is an awareness of the pain both countries have suffered, and will continue to suffer, until the rift between them is healed. This young perspective, free of the prejudices of the past, is what might be able to finally set the world on a course to healing and understanding.</p>

<p>The GSS Germany project was the second step on a journey for young people of both countries to understand each other. The first step began last year, in Normandy, with students from America, France and Germany.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1014904_771689536231714_4995988475168259425_o.jpg"><img alt="1014904_771689536231714_4995988475168259425_o" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4387" height="225" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1014904_771689536231714_4995988475168259425_o-300x225.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>That was the beginning, but by no means was it the end. The bonds formed during that project led to the creation of the Germany Project, which focused specifically on German-American relations post-WWII.</p>

<p>The first part of this project began in March, when sixteen German students from the Bergschule St. Elizabeth came to America. Most of us were strangers- only four American students from the Normandy Project took part in this second project- but it never felt that way. Every single member of the group leaned in from the beginning, allowing the connections to be formed immediately. We pushed ourselves, asking questions that were painful or difficult, putting our personal histories out into the open. We had to deal with weighty topics, such as the Holocaust, the Berlin Wall, the Soviet Union&rsquo;s treatment of Eastern German citizens. And it wasn&rsquo;t easy. The script for the first performance focused on questions- what is the price of freedom? What does it mean to be American? To be German? To be Jewish, and to have a family history deeply rooted in the events of the Holocaust? How do we connect across linguistic and cultural borders? How do we form friendships when our countries have a history of hatred and hostility towards each other?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1412431_1590639591178668_1012579317943632380_o.jpg"><img alt="1412431_1590639591178668_1012579317943632380_o" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4388" height="200" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1412431_1590639591178668_1012579317943632380_o-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>The second part of the project began in June, when the sixteen American students traveled to Germany. To quote a line from the script, &ldquo;It was like coming home after years.&rdquo; This time, we focused on ourselves- the connections we have with each other, the bonds that were formed. This time it wasn&rsquo;t about questioning the world about what they would do to achieve peace and freedom. We asked ourselves what we could do to make a difference, digging deep into our personal histories and feelings about the subject matter. The second script felt like it came from our hearts. Each time we performed it, we weren&rsquo;t acting as characters, telling another person&rsquo;s story. It was our story- the incredible story of how thirty-five students were brave enough to get into the room and start the conversation about peace between America and Germany.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/11695007_1624222017820425_4774987575960018659_n.jpg"><img alt="11695007_1624222017820425_4774987575960018659_n" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4390" height="225" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/11695007_1624222017820425_4774987575960018659_n-300x225.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/11722202_1624083071167653_7374709022828859367_o.jpg"><img alt="11722202_1624083071167653_7374709022828859367_o" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4389" height="200" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/11722202_1624083071167653_7374709022828859367_o-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>This project was about getting people from different cultures, countries and continents in the same room, to get us to connect across all those boundaries. But we did more than connect- we formed lifelong friendships that run deeper than the arbitrary borders set out by political leaders. If 35 students can do this work, other people in the world can. All it takes is courage and an open heart.</p>

		<title>Cat-Calling Is Not A Game</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-10-at-5.41.29-PM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 5.41.29 PM" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4396" height="300" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-10-at-5.41.29-PM-212x300.png" width="212" /></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s not fair. Double standards are not fair. Being told as a young girl to never be alone is not fair. Media regarding women is not fair. Wearing skirtsdown to your knees and shirts that cover your shoulders in school is not fair. Sexual objectification of women is not fair. My &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not fair&rdquo; of the week is: It&rsquo;s not fair that when I wake up before my summer classes in NYC, I have to TRY to look a certain way in hopes I don&rsquo;t get stared at by men on the train and hollered at by men walking to my class.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Catcalling. It disgusts me. What goes through a man&rsquo;s head while catcalling? Maybe men try to impress their friends by catcalling women. Maybe men believe they will find their true love if they whistle at them. But do men actually think they will attract a woman&rsquo;s interest and attention by sexually harassing them? Probably not, but based on their behaviors it certainly appears that way. To me, catcalling is a man&rsquo;s fight for dominance. It&rsquo;s a man playing a game-&nbsp;a pretty nasty game&nbsp;if I must say so myself.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In this game, they have to find a woman- or should I say object of their attention. They can start simple,&nbsp;with just a whistle. If the woman&nbsp;is only slightly offended, he may feel he can escalate things and get more aggressive. Next he can grade her, tell her she is an 8 out of 10. Maybe he truly believes that women love it when you sexually objectify them, so he wants to tell her she&rsquo;s sexy and tell her he wants to be with her. Finally,&nbsp;if she just walks away he&rsquo;ll call her a b***ch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Maybe men would get a more positive result by playing a different game, one that doesn&#39;t involve demeaning women&hellip;</p>

<p dir="ltr">It was the degrading of women that sparked my project. It is the understanding that, when I wake up before a day in the city, I have to tailor the way I dress and the makeup I wear to avoid attracting the wrong attention. It is the understanding that, when I am around a group of men whom I sense are ogling, I&rsquo;ll feel the need to give them the same disgusting look back, so they will feel uninterested in looking at me. Women (and all genders and identities who are exploited) should be able to wear what they want and do what they want, without the fear that they will get catcalled, harassed, or dare I say, raped. Sure, studies shows that, in most rape cases, the rapist does not think about how the victim is dressed, but that has never stopped the powers that be from asserting&mdash;well, maybe she was asking for it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I began taking portraits of myself dressed up as the most common cat calls. For me,&nbsp;being catcalled makes me want to go home and take a shower.&nbsp;I know other women have felt the same way, but they don&rsquo;t know where to go or what to do. I wanted an artistic outlet to shout at the men who catcall that, &nbsp;&quot;I am not your child, so don&#39;t call me your baby!&quot;. I also wanted an artistic outlet to give to women to show them that they are not alone in the fight against the degradation of women.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I dressed up and photographed all of my portraits at school. After my photos were done, I left my makeup on and walked the halls between classes, to see what kind of attention I would draw. I received very positive feedback from both students and faculty alike-&nbsp;they wanted to know more about my project. Except for one encounter, when an older boy asked &quot;when are we going to role play in bed?&quot; in front of all of his friends. His response didn&rsquo;t discourage me, but rather it made me feel sorry for him. This boy was not taught that making racy comments is not how to win a women, this boy was not taught that cracking sexual jokes for egoistic purposes can rub people the wrong way, and this boy was definitely not taught how to respect the opposite sex. Aside from this encounter, all the other feedback was nothing but positive, with teachers even asking me if they could get a print of my poster to hang in their classroom. This was the feedback I was hoping for, and through this project I discovered that I am not alone in the race to end gender inequalities.&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">After a roasting summer there&rsquo;s nothing like breathing in the fresh, crisp air of a new season. Fall, the time where everything from nature to material is evolving, introduces us with a fresh slate for the rest of the short year. Although high school seniors are freaking out about college applications, there are quite a few things they&rsquo;re actually looking forward to doing!&nbsp;I polled a handful of my fellow seniors on what they are most excited about for the new season:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-23-at-1.58.19-PM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-23 at 1.58.19 PM" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4403" height="897" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-23-at-1.58.19-PM-1024x897.png" width="1024" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">Out of the group of people I polled, it looks like the new fall trends and the beautiful changing colors of the leaves&nbsp;are in the lead.&nbsp;Who isn&#39;t excited to wear new jackets and boots through the autumn leaves! Welcome, Fall!&nbsp;</p>

		<title>The Backpack Craze</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When walking around the high school, it&rsquo;s hard not to notice the 17 year olds carrying backpacks designed for toddlers. As a lower classman not so long ago, I wondered, how do people fit all their books in such a tiny backpack? I now know the answer is that they don&rsquo;t. So why even go through the&nbsp;struggle of carrying around these miniature, sparkling backpacks? I imagined it was just a way for people to express themselves in a silly way.&nbsp; Little did I know, &nbsp;I would end up being&nbsp;one of these seniors carrying a minuscule, somewhat ridiculous backpack around everyday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that I am finally a senior I truly understand the whole backpack phenomenon.&nbsp; Starting high school as a freshmen, you always think about being a senior, but you never really know what it will feel like.&nbsp; I had always envisioned that seniors never did homework, went to school rarely and just hung out with their friends all the time.&nbsp; Although I am guilty of a little bit of that, it is generally&nbsp;far from the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year is the first time I have felt like I am actually being forced into the adult world. Whether it is applying to college, driving, or anything else, many&nbsp;responsibilities&nbsp;are&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;on me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s scary to go from a world of security&nbsp;and safety to being thrown out on our own.&nbsp; Soon,&nbsp;many of us will head off to college and really have to advocate and be responsible for ourselves and that&rsquo;s even scarier. Although 17 or 18 years is still young, we are now considered young adults and have to kiss our youth goodbye. For those of us not ready for that, our silly backpacks are a way to hold on to the feeling of being a kid again. &nbsp;For me, I know my silly backpack, with the &ldquo;world&#39;s cutest dog, Boo&rdquo; on it, is a way to hold on to my adolescence for a little longer. &nbsp;So enjoy your journey to adulthood, but remember you&rsquo;re never to old to act like a kid again.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking to be entertained? Look no further! The Friends Academy community is about to receive a new and fun way to get in touch with the happenings of the school. In collaboration with junior Cade Huseby, Inkwell will soon be publicly releasing <em>Cade&rsquo;s Corner</em>, a YouTube channel revolving around Friends Academy.</p>

<p>Huseby, who has already become well known throughout the school for his personal YouTube videos, says that the channel will &ldquo;<em>mostly&nbsp;</em>cover school-based topics in a satirical, late-night-show fashioned manner.&rdquo; Each new episode will showcase the feature of one special guest from within our community. When inquired as to the nature of each of his guests, Huseby responded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;[Guests] on the show&hellip; will definitely need something to talk about&hellip; Although a talent or piece of work would make for a great discussion topic, people are welcome to apply to be on the show just by emailing me with a rough idea of what they would want to &lsquo;plug&rsquo; or talk about. We welcome students, faculty, and even teachers to be a part of the show in whatever way they want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pilot episode of the show (release date to be determined) will feature well-known musician and senior Sam Towse. &ldquo;We have a few ideas already planned out to make sure it will be a fun, smooth-running, show,&rdquo; said Huseby with respect to the premiere episode. After that, new episodes are expected to release weekly, although &ldquo;the posting schedule will most likely vary depending on school holidays, popularity of the series, and other technical factors.&rdquo; The links to new episodes of <em>Cade&rsquo;s Corner</em> will be sent out in public emails to the whole school.</p>

<p>Huseby was first approached with the idea of <em>Cade&rsquo;s Corner</em> by Inkwell editor-in-chief Olivia Fine because of his past successes in creating YouTube videos:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw some weekly newscasts from other schools this summer, and I immediately thought of Cade. Knowing his talent for vlogging and video editing, I thought he would be the perfect person for the job. Also, I have heard other of students&#39; interest in broadcast journalism and I wanted to create the opportunity for them&rdquo; (Fine). Fine stated that she will produce and also help direct the production.</p>

<p>The two intend to gear the show towards the entire FA community. Although the channel will mostly be concerned with upper school topics-&nbsp;students of all ages, their parents, and teachers alike are encouraged to watch.</p>

<p>Huseby expressed his excitement about the upcoming segments: &nbsp;&ldquo;I always wanted to share these types of videos with the school and I believe this is a great way to bring a light-heartedness and fun environment into what can be a stressful one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t miss out!</p>

		<title>Getting to Know Ms. DeBlasi</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent interview with Ms. DeBlasi, she offered me a look into&nbsp;her past, along with sharing her interests inside and outside of the Friends community.&nbsp; Ms. DeBlasi grew up in the&nbsp;small town of Somerset, in central New Jersey.&nbsp;After graduating high school, DeBlasi went on to college and then graduate school in Massachusetts. Since then, DeBlasi has continued to teach for a total of ten years, this being her eleventh.&nbsp; Her teaching years included teaching in Massachusetts, Mexico, Portugal, Morocco, and a charter school in the Bronx. When asked, DeBlasi clarified that these schools out of the USA were international schools, catering to students living abroad due to their parent&rsquo;s job, yet serving as the local population as well.&nbsp; Throughout her career, she has always taught high school English, remarking on the fact that this is first year serving as an academic counselor. Included is a piece of our interview:</p>

<p><em>How has your experience at FA been so far?</em></p>

<p>So far my experience at FA has been great!&nbsp; The staff and students are all very friendly and welcoming, and I like that I have two roles here (teacher and counselor).&nbsp; I think the campus is gorgeous and I love the lunch!&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>What are your expectations for this year?&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>I think this year will be a lot about me learning the culture of FA and getting to know as many students as I can.&nbsp; I hope many will stop by to visit me, to go over their transcripts, talk about electives, or ask about out of school opportunities for participating in activities.</p>

<p><em>What were you most nervous for entering a new school?</em></p>

<p>I was most nervous about the commute!&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had a car for 8 years but I had to get one to start working here.&nbsp; I was particularly worried about parking at home, because I live in the city and have to find a spot on the street every day. But that&#39;s been fine and I even started carpooling with Mrs. Levy!&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>What are you most looking forward to entering the FA community?</em></p>

<p>I am excited to be a part of a school where the adults and students all seem to really care about learning and education.&nbsp; I am very humbled by how gifted the staff here is, and how vibrant and happy the community is.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great place to come every day.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Any other exciting or interesting facts you would like to share about yourself!</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;My favorite flower is the Gerbera Daisy, and my favorite book is &quot;The Little Prince&quot;! &nbsp; I also really hate watching movies because I can&#39;t sit still for two straight hours.&nbsp;In my free time I love to read on my hammock, dog-sit my friend&#39;s French Bulldog, travel, take yoga classes, and watch reruns of old TV shows on Netflix!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My family is pretty small; I grew up with just my mother, who actually just got married this past Saturday!&nbsp; I was the Maid of Honor in her wedding and it was a really special day for my whole family.&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">9 Tips to a Successful School Year</p>

<p align="center">By Jacob Rush</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school year is officially in full swing, and with that in mind, we here at Inkwell would like to give everybody some tips to a prosperous 2015-2016 school year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Breakfast: The most important meal of the day! It&rsquo;s necessary to have your mind ready and be completely focused on schoolwork. How can you do that on an empty stomach? An apple or banana in the morning could never hurt!</li>
	<li>Relationships with teachers: It never hurts to make a friend out of a teacher especially since they are there to help you out!</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t Cram: This can&rsquo;t be said enough. It&rsquo;s important to stay on top of your work, but above all else, set aside time that is designated for work so everything isn&rsquo;t put off until the last minute.</li>
	<li>Stay Punctual: Being late just doesn&rsquo;t look good. Arriving to both school and classes on time is an easy way to avoid conflict.</li>
	<li>Join Clubs: Friends Academy has a diverse range of clubs from CANstruction all the way to our very own student publication &ldquo;Inkwell&rdquo;. A great way to stay involved is to become members of all the clubs that the school offers.</li>
	<li>Branch Out: As important as academic life is, it&rsquo;s also important to move out of your comfort zone to improve the social aspects of your life. The simplest thing as inviting the new guy to sit at your table can go a long way.</li>
	<li>Take Advantage of Frees: It&rsquo;s easy to slack off when you have free time, but it&rsquo;s a very good idea to use your free time to move ahead on work. This leaves you time at home to relax and not spend as much time worrying about every little thing.</li>
	<li>Correct Supplies: It may sound obvious, but why would anyone put themselves in a position where they don&rsquo;t have adequate materials for class?!</li>
	<li>Enjoy Yourself: Above all else, this is the most essential tip to take away from this article. After all, the times you will remember most in high school will be the times you spent with your friends, not the times crammed up in bedroom studying!</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Use these tips wisely and good luck to everyone this year!</p>

		<title>Autumn Trends on Campus</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2015/09/28/autumn-trends-on-campus/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the start of each school year, new styles always seem to follow. Each year is different; from skater skirts to the annually updated J-Crew down-feather vest, Friends Academy style evolves&nbsp;and tries&nbsp;new ideas. This year, after&nbsp;observing the student body, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that we&rsquo;ve picked up a few new tricks:</p>

<p>1) The style evolution of Sperry&rsquo;s. It used to be all about Sperry Top-Sider&rsquo;s traditional boat shoe, but the girls on campus have leveled up to the lace-up sneaker. Though there were a few pairs interspersed throughout the crowds last year, this trend has picked up since the start of school! If you&rsquo;d like to jump on board with this fad, you can find them on the <em>Sperry </em>website.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2090618_fpx.tif.jpeg"><img alt="2090618_fpx.tif" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4453" height="300" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2090618_fpx.tif-245x300.jpeg" width="245" /></a></p>

<p>2) The half-up, half-down bun is getting serious. I&rsquo;ve spotted it around campus a few time and celebs such as Hilary Duff and J-Lo are doing it too. Why not give it a shot? It&rsquo;s very simple to do. This effortlessly cute style is similar to the half-up half-down ponytail, except you put the small portion of hair into any type of bun preferable.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hilary-duff-half-knot1.jpg"><img alt="hilary-duff-half-knot1" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4451" height="300" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hilary-duff-half-knot1-300x300.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>3)&nbsp;For those cold days during winter or autumn, when all you want to do is put on a giant sweater and call it a day, throw on a false-collar sweater! I&rsquo;ve seen a few among the FA crowds, and even I have a couple. They are super comfy and also look like you&rsquo;re wearing a collar (Shh.. don&rsquo;t tell your teachers). It&rsquo;s stylish, comfy, and following the rules, well, sort of. <em>Comptoirs Des Cotonniers </em>has adorable ones! Go check &lsquo;em out!</p>

		<title>Back to School: 5 Tips to Help</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to school can be tough, especially if you are a new student or an incoming freshman. Even if you aren&rsquo;t, however, transitioning back into the swing of things can still be difficult. Here are 5 tips that will hopefully help you adjust!</p>

<ol>
	<li>Stay organized: it is important to keep track of all of your classes, your homework, your extracurricular activities, and your schedule in general. It is crucial that you find a way to remember all of these things, so try keeping a planner. A planner is an easy way to write down homework, and even keep track of your schedule. You can use an actual planner, or even just a notebook or a note pad. If you don&rsquo;t like writing things down, try setting reminders on your phone, or filling in a calendar either on your phone or on your computer. There are so many easy and convenient ways to stay organized, try some!</li>
	<li>Ask teachers for help: If you feel as if you are struggling in a class, or falling behind, or if you are confused on a subject, ask your teacher for help. The teachers here are more than happy to help you, and really can give you the help you need. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help, it&rsquo;s so easy to just stop in and ask a question or to email your teacher and ask for a time that you can meet with them. If you need help with writing, the Writing Center is a great place to go! Don&rsquo;t be afraid to reach out for help about anything, your teachers are always willing to help.</li>
	<li>Follow the rules: Not to sound scary or intimidating, but it is extremely important to follow the rules. If you follow dress code, abide by the basic rules, listen to your teacher, arrive on time, life at school will run smoothly. Abiding by the rules is actually fairly simple, and it&rsquo;s important to stay out of trouble!</li>
	<li>Take advantage of opportunities: Friends Academy is full of opportunities. Try something new, or follow your passion. Play a sport, participate in the play, or join a club. No matter what, make sure you fully take advantage of everything that is offered here. There is so much to do and so much to be a part of, and you can make both great memories and great friends.</li>
	<li>Relax: Enjoy your time here. It may seem like you have a long way to go, and way too much work to enjoy yourself, but school is actually fun if you let it be fun. Don&rsquo;t overwhelm yourself. &nbsp;It can be easy to get caught up in your work, so remember to take a step back and relax.</li>
</ol>

		<title>Global Citizens Festival 2015</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, September 26, over 60,000 individuals descended on Central Park&#39;s Great Lawn, all gathered together for one purpose: to celebrate the UN&#39;s unveiling of the new Global Goals (and of course to hear some amazing music).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/festival_1.jpg"><img alt="festival_1" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4483" height="169" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/festival_1-300x169.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>The tradition of the Global Citizens Festival began in 2013, but the Global Citizen project itself began one year earlier in 2012. The Global Poverty Project, Ryan Gall and Riot House created it as a &quot;hub for innovative campaigns that work towards a world where every child can survive and thrive. A world where every child has a chance to go to school, a world where women and girls are protected from violence, and where preventable diseases aren&#39;t holding people back.&quot; The purpose of the festival is to continue to raise awareness about the issues plaguing our society today: extreme poverty, gender violence, HIV/AIDS, women&#39;s rights, and many more.</p>

<p>But what makes this festival unique? It&#39;s free- somewhat. While no one has to pay for a general assembly ticket, you do have to earn admission. How? By completing action journeys on the Global Citizens website.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/action-journey-4.jpg"><img alt="action-journey-4" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4484" height="300" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/action-journey-4-265x300.jpg" width="265" /></a></p>

<p>These action journeys are completed by tweeting, writing emails, making phone calls and signing petitions, all to urge world leaders and other individuals in positions of power to make the changes in their respective countries that our society so desperately needs.</p>

<p>So, before you even get to the festival, you are already pushing for change. Then, when you arrive, you receive the reward for your hard work: An afternoon and night of inspiring speeches, videos and incredible music performances.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/kerry-washington-2015-global-citizen-festival-in-new-york-city_8.jpg"><img alt="kerry-washington-2015-global-citizen-festival-in-new-york-city_8" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4485" height="300" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/kerry-washington-2015-global-citizen-festival-in-new-york-city_8-199x300.jpg" width="199" /></a> <a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/150927104438-beyonce-global-citizen-exlarge-169.jpg"><img alt="150927104438-beyonce-global-citizen-exlarge-169" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4501" height="145" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/150927104438-beyonce-global-citizen-exlarge-169-300x168.jpg" width="258" /></a></p>

<p>This year&#39;s festival was slightly different from that of the previous two years. This time, the festival was timed to occur simultaneously with the United Nation&#39;s announcement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This is the second installment of worldwide, transnational goals designed to create a better world for all citizens of all countries; the first were the Millenium Development Goals, ratified in 2000 with a target date of 2015. These goals provided incentives for all member nations to work together to achieve things like the eradication of extreme poverty and the end of gender inequality, but we still aren&#39;t there yet. To keep pushing for these necessary changes, the 193 member nations of the UN created a new set of goals (the SDGs), with a wider focus and more mechanisms of implementation.</p>

<p>For those of you who did not/were unable to attend the festival, here are some highlights of the evening (which were really difficult to choose, given that everything about the festival was amazing and inspiring):</p>

<p>1. Queen Rania of Jordan, Chime for Change Co-Founder Salma Hayek Pinault and First Vice President of the European Commission (EU) Frans Timmermans declaring support for the refugees.</p>

<p>2. David Cameron (Britain&#39;s Prime Minister) speaking from a refugee camp in Lebanon:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/011-mikaki-refugee-camp.jpg"><img alt="011-mikaki-refugee-camp" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4489" height="162" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/011-mikaki-refugee-camp-300x197.jpg" width="246" /></a><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hqdefault.jpg"><img alt="hqdefault" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4490" height="152" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hqdefault-300x225.jpg" width="203" /></a></p>

<p>3. Ed Sheeran performing and having the crowd make hearts with their hands:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ed-sheeran-the-voice-2015-billboard-650.jpg"><img alt="ed-sheeran-the-voice-2015-billboard-650" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4492" height="113" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ed-sheeran-the-voice-2015-billboard-650-300x198.jpg" width="171" /></a><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2780.jpg"><img alt="2780" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4491" height="153" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2780-300x180.jpg" width="253" /></a></p>

<p>4. Joe Biden&#39;s speech rallying the crowd against extreme poverty and urging everyone to advocate for universal rights for all:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I look out and I see lots of global citizens, optimistic, determined, absolutely determined, rejecting the false premise that our challenges are mere fate, with no solutions, and that protecting universal rights is equally universal, because it is.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>5. Common performing his hit song <em>Glory</em> from the movie <em>Selma</em>, reminding the audience of the horrors of racial inequality</p>

<p>that so many still face.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sting-and-common-getty.jpg"><img alt="sting-and-common-getty" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4493" height="169" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sting-and-common-getty-300x169.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>6. Beyonce&#39;s mind-blowing, empowering performance that showcased the theme of female empowerment and gender equality (because girls run the world).</p>

<p>7. Michelle Obama&#39;s video and speech on her important campaign, Let Girls Learn. This movement seeks to get more girls in primary and secondary school, because &quot;to educate a girl is to build a healthier family, a stronger community, and a brighter future.&quot; The first lady urged the use of the hashtag #62milliongirls to showcase what you have learned in school, and to drive home the fact that, in the world today, <strong>62 million girls</strong> are not in school.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_4498" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img alt="US First Lady Michelle Obama speaks at the fourth annual Global Citizen Festival in Central Park Manhattan on September 26, 2015 in New York.

<p>8. And last but not least, Malala Yousafzai&#39;s empowering, inspiring speech on the universal right of education, specifically for women. This young woman has become an icon for girls all over the world because of her bravery and willingness to stand up for what she believes in, but she is also humble, sharing the stage with four other young women activists from Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria, telling the audience that their names will be known one day soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/malala-gcf_wide-bf78d21c361bb666b6ad7ea4fa6de8b2333a1056-s900-c85.jpg"><img alt="malala-gcf_wide-bf78d21c361bb666b6ad7ea4fa6de8b2333a1056-s900-c85" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4497" height="169" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/malala-gcf_wide-bf78d21c361bb666b6ad7ea4fa6de8b2333a1056-s900-c85-300x169.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>Global Citizens Festival 2015 was an evening of incredible musical performances, but it was so much more than that: It was a celebration of the progress we as a world have made, but also a reminder of how much further we have to go. The lofty global goals announced at the festival are ambitious- but not unattainable. It will take every single person&#39;s awareness and drive to achieve them. We as a world will do it, because failure isn&#39;t an option here.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One piece of advice that&rsquo;s given frequently to new students is that they should try to make connections with their teachers. But for a lot of people, that&rsquo;s easier said than done. Becoming friends with your teachers can seem a little far-fetched; they&rsquo;re adults that stand at the front of classrooms trying to help you understand concepts like World War II or titration. They have a lot of power over you; they control grades, and they can hand out punishments. From a distance, teachers can seem a little scary. But far too often, us students forget that our teachers are just people.</p>

<p>An important part of what makes Friends Academy differnet from other schools is that so many teachers are here because they actually love teaching. This makes a lot of them approachable and easy to connect with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1410666_782813935108320_2737827182560163538_o.jpg"><img alt="1410666_782813935108320_2737827182560163538_o" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4514" height="200" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1410666_782813935108320_2737827182560163538_o-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>Personally, some of the best conversations and experiences I have had at Friends Academy have been when I am spending time in a teacher&rsquo;s room during my free periods. These people who teach us about history, or science, or english, or any other subject can also teach us so much about life in general. These kind of connections are the norm at Friends Academy, not the exception; so many alumni have stories of that one teacher they just really connected with and who guided them through so much of their time at school.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10556889_782813681775012_1377693605127268159_o.jpg"><img alt="10556889_782813681775012_1377693605127268159_o" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4515" height="300" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10556889_782813681775012_1377693605127268159_o-200x300.jpg" width="200" /></a></p>

<p>These deep connections with teachers take time to form. They aren&rsquo;t going to happen if you&rsquo;re only going to see the teacher when you&rsquo;re having trouble in their class. They happen when you spend time with them for no reason other than to just talk about random stuff, like last night&rsquo;s football game or your mutual love of cooking. It may sound shocking, but teachers have a life outside of the walls of Friends Academy- and so often, those lives are really interesting and cool to hear about. Furthermore, having these relationships with teachers can be very helpful if you find yourself struggling with an assignment; Oftentimes, teachers are more open to assisting the students that have made an effort in the past.</p>

<p>To close, I&rsquo;m going to repeat this piece of advice that I&rsquo;m sure you have heard so many times: Form relationships with your teachers. It&rsquo;s worth the effort. The teachers I have become friends with have become a source of indispensable advice, people I can laugh with, and role models I can learn from. It&rsquo;s so easy to connect with the teachers at Friends , and it will almost certainly improve your high school experience.</p>

		<title>5 Steps to De-Stress</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2015/10/17/5-steps-to-de-stress/</link>

<p>It&rsquo;s only early October but it&rsquo;s very clear that the stress level has already spiked among students. Whether rushing to get all our&nbsp;homework done before a sports game, trying to submit those college applications (sympathy goes to seniors),&nbsp;or cramming last minute for that history test, we are all feeling the pressure.&nbsp; So how can we relieve this stress quickly before it really interferes with our health and grades? Here are 5 easy steps to de-stress.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>1. Plan Ahead</u></strong></p>

<p>If you know that you have 2 tests tomorrow and a soccer game tonight, start studying earlier in the week so it doesn&rsquo;t feel so overwhelming the night before the assessment.</p>

<p><strong><u>2. Make use of free periods or study halls</u></strong></p>

<p>As tempting as it may be to talk with friends or fool around during frees or study halls, these are times made for students to do work.&nbsp;Take advantage of this time by getting your homework for the night done so you can enjoy your evening, relaxing at home.</p>

<p><strong><u>3.&nbsp; Go to extra help</u></strong></p>

<p>Is the difficulty of your science class creating unnecessary anxiety? Well, schedule an appointment to meet with you teacher to go over material that may be confusing to you! This is sure to make difficult concepts more clear.</p>

<p><strong><u>4. Exercise </u></strong></p>

<p>As silly as it might sound, 30 minutes of exercise a day will 100% make your day a little less stressful.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re talking a walk, jogging or playing field hockey, your mind is concentrated on those activities rather than that APUSH DBQ waiting on your desk.</p>

<p><strong><u>5. GO TO SLEEP!</u></strong></p>

<p>Trust me I know how hard it &nbsp;can be&nbsp;to stay awake during school.&nbsp;Watching Netflix or texting your friends instead of getting those 9 hours you were always told were essential, can be prove to be detrimental.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the phone down,&nbsp;shut your computer and go to sleep at a normal hour.&nbsp; Waking up feeling refreshed and energized will make it easier to tackle the day&rsquo;s challenges without feeling rundown.&nbsp; Sleep is ESSENTIAL to&nbsp;success, and should be a main priority for anyone feeling overwhelmed. &nbsp;</p>

		<title>Getting to Know Mr. Schoeffel</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-11.28.10-AM.png" rel="" style="" target="" title="">[caption id="attachment_4534" align="alignnone" width="231"]<img alt="Mark Schoffel" class="size-full wp-image-4534 wp-caption alignnone" height="292" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-11.28.10-AM.png" style="" title="" width="231" />Photo courtesy of www.fa.org[/caption]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Schoeffel is a pretty cool guy. It is safe to say he has already been a good fit here at Friends as well as the school being a good place for him. This past week I caught up with the new head of the upper school, and he had some pretty good things to say.</p>

<p>Q: Let&rsquo;s get to know you better. Who is Mr. Schoeffel?</p>

<p><em>A: I have lots of random facts actually. I was born in Toronto, Canada and I grew up playing hockey, and I followed the Maple Leafs. I was a cub scout which I really enjoyed and I also really enjoyed school. I went to a pretty traditional prep school called: Upper Canada College, which really shaped me a lot with many of the teachers I met. I connected with many of my teachers on a personal level. I later applied for the (NHL) draft when I was 16. I definitely wanted to get involved with schools after college. I thought about doing some financial stuff, but eventually I wound up coaching and that led me into teaching and I&rsquo;ve been involved with schools ever since. I have a wife of over 20 years and 3 kids. We&rsquo;ve moved around a bit but we really have enjoyed our time here so far.</em></p>

<p>Q: What prior knowledge/exposure did you have, if any, to Quakerism before coming to Friends?</p>

<p><em>A: Well, at the school I originally taught at, Shipley, one of my closest friends and mentors was a French teacher and a practicing Quaker. I had many friends that were Quakers that acted as mentors. Shipley has participated in the &ldquo;Friends League&rdquo; which is a sports league between various Friends schools. Ironically, Shipley was founded by women who were Quaker but decided not to make the school Quaker. I had been to some Quaker meetings in the past by my own choosing, and participated in some very powerful meetings even though I&rsquo;m not a practicing Quaker. The ethics of values of Quaker schools have always been near to my heart.</em></p>

<p>Q: To this point, what has made Friends different than any other place you&rsquo;ve been to before?</p>

<p><em>A: People are very intentional about asking what each other think and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be just a formality. It seems like people are genuinely interested in what others have to say. The whole idea of a collective input as well as equal student views appear to be big in this community, and although that&rsquo;s not totally unique to me, it&rsquo;s very evident here. I also think, and many kids may not notice but, a lot of you guys present very well. You do a great job of reaching out to others.</em></p>

<p>Q: We as students tend to set out goals for ourselves before each year. Did you do the same? If so, what goals did you have for yourself.</p>

<p><em>A: Getting to know everyone to the point that I know all of their first names as well as getting to know all of the faculty. I also just really want to live up to our mission in a way that is balanced but not overwhelming. Everyone always talks about the difficulties of high school but for me, high school was a time of exploration and taking risks. I know we all aspire to be an environment where the freedom and support is always there but I understand that it&rsquo;s not always easy with outside pressures and so I would like for us to find a balanced solution where we can all work together. I know it&rsquo;s an ambitious goal but I do want to try for it.</em></p>

<p>Q: Last question, if you could be any character ever whether it be literature, a&nbsp;T.V. show, or a movie, who are you?</p>

<p><em>A: Wow. I&rsquo;m not a hobbit although I do like hobbits. I can&rsquo;t say I would want to be Jesus Christ or Socrates because they both carry too much responsibility. I&rsquo;d consider being Popeye or maybe Charlie Brown even though he doesn&rsquo;t have a great ride. I don&rsquo;t really want to be a superhero although my son would definitely want me to. I would really be interested to be someone that has a far different perspective&nbsp;than I do.</em></p>

		<title>The Exclusivity of Spirit Week</title>

<p>With the conclusion of the&nbsp;annual Friends Academy homecoming week, one sentiment in particular has been echoed by students and faculty alike:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;What just happened?!&rdquo; </em></p>

<p>This question has stumped many since the very origins of the legendary event. However, an in-depth analysis of the event may shed light upon Spirit Week&rsquo;s inner workings.</p>

<p>The hype which revolves&nbsp;around the so-called &ldquo;Spirit Week&rdquo; commences with the incredibly grandiose reveal of the week&rsquo;s dress-up themes: the administration sends a discrete email to the entire Upper School the Friday afternoon preceding Spirit Week, announcing its upcoming existence for the first time. Such impeccable timing leaves students with more than enough time (two whole days!) to plan their ornate get-ups for the entire week. Each student&nbsp;is sure they will&nbsp;top each of their peers&rsquo; outfits in a competition that can only be hailed as Survival of the Best Dressed.</p>

<p>As demonstrated by the unwavering commitment of many students to go all-out during this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Logo Day&rdquo; or &ldquo;Advisory Theme Day,&rdquo; Spirit Week is not something taken lightly in Friends Academy. When deciding upon their ensemble, students this year were required to deliberate for several seconds, if not entire minutes, as to which one of their numerous college sweatshirts or pajama pants they should wear on such theme days. Who gets to decide these unusually creative and original themes? Definitely not the student body, for the task of coming up with a better idea to top &ldquo;Decades Day&rdquo; or &ldquo;Logo Day&rdquo; must be deemed far beyond students&rsquo; meager capabilities.</p>

<p>Perhaps the buildup to Spirit Week truly climaxes on the last day. The highly anticipated pep rally brings the whole school into one screaming flock of people. Upper school sports team members line up procession-style, prepared to make their individual group entrances and emerge as the reigning sport, cheered on by the masses (masses meaning the 400 or so lower and middle school students shrieking in high-pitched voices and blowing horns incessantly, swept up in a frenetic rush of mob mentality). In groups categorized by sport, athletes thunder out onto the catwalk created between the throng of people, asserting their social dominance by yelling and crying out their sport&rsquo;s name with such ferocity that it can only be attributed to survival of the fittest. Finally, after approximately twenty minutes of ear-shattering cacophony, pep rally inexplicably stops and students swarm out of the building while teachers attempt to stop the stampede by restricting exit routes.</p>

<p>Why did this becoming our annual tradition? To the 10% of the upper school not involved in after-school sports, pep rally is simply an orchestration of the jocks- a way for them to forcibly display and exert their social domination upon the rest of the school. Non-athletes (even if only for the fall season) are left awkwardly gaping from the sidelines with no real team to cheer for. Since when did school spirit manifest itself solely in sports? It seems that to truly embrace the principles of inclusivity and school spirit, pep rally should allow all students- not just athletes- an equal opportunity to take part in the event. After all, why can&rsquo;t musical-oriented students sing or play their instruments in the procession? Why must it be reserved for the jocks? Even more importantly, why must pep rally be all about typecasting groups of people as &ldquo;athletes&rdquo; or &ldquo;none of the above&rdquo;? Competition during Spirit Week is understandable, but perhaps we would be better off reorganizing our pep rally into a competition between the grades rather than a competition between the athletes,&nbsp;thereby excluding everyone else. At&nbsp;Friends Academy, where exclusion of any sort is prohibited, it seems highly paradoxical that one of the most anticipated events of the year revolves around exclusivity.</p>

<p>In many ways, Spirit Week embodies the inconsistencies present in Friends Academy&rsquo;s everyday life. Perhaps we as a school should put greater thought into this special week for next year in order to improve the overall experience of our community.</p>

		<title>Captivating &quot;Supermoon&quot; Eclipse</title>

<p>On September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2015, much of the Americas, Europe, Africa, areas of the eastern Pacific, and parts of West Asia witnessed a total lunar eclipse during a supermoon. &nbsp;Lasting 1 hour and 11 minutes, the eclipse began at 8:11p.m. EDT and peaked at 10:47 p.m. EDT.</p>

<p>In ancient civilizations, people interpreted a lunar eclipse as a &ldquo;sign from the gods&rdquo; since they didn&rsquo;t understand what was actually occurring. So let&rsquo;s get down to the science behind it.</p>

<p>A lunar eclipse results from the Earth blocking sunlight that would normally reach the Moon&rsquo;s surface. Instead, the shadow of Earth projects upon the Moon. This shadow has two parts, the umbra and the penumbra. An eclipse begins as the Moon enters the penumbra of the Earth&rsquo;s shadow. This is the least exciting part; there is still a lot of sunlight shining off the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere that is cast upon the lunar surface. &nbsp;The umbra, the darkest part of the shadow, is considered the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; of the lunar eclipse, when the least amount of light is refracting off the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. The eclipse ends after the Moon travels through the penumbra of the Earth&rsquo;s shadow again.</p>

<p>The red coloration of the lunar surface results from the refraction of the light present in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>

<p>A supermoon means the moon appears approximately 14 percent larger than normal since it&rsquo;s closer to Earth due to the moon&rsquo;s non-circular orbit.</p>

<p>The pairing of a total lunar eclipse and a supermoon is very rare.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t occurred since 1982, and will not repeat until 2033. Many students&nbsp;reported seeing the eclipse and feeling overall astonishment towards it.&nbsp;</p>

		<title>Don&#039;t Treat Me Like A Costume</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2015/10/17/dont-treat-me-like-a-costume/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[embed]https://flic.kr/p/8PTiC9[/embed]</p>

<p>With Halloween quickly approaching, the pressure to discover&nbsp;of the perfect costume is growing. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s really no problem, because this year&#39;s noteworthy events&nbsp;have&nbsp;given us so&nbsp;many different things to dress up as! &nbsp;Choices may range from pop culture&nbsp;icons such as Beyonc&eacute;, all the way to comfy animal onesies. &nbsp;The sky is really the&nbsp;limit this Halloween. &nbsp;There are Halloween costumes, however, that cross the line of&nbsp;funny and spooky and enter the territory of disrespect. &nbsp;Those costumes are ones&nbsp;that appropriate the cultures of other people. &nbsp;Cultural appropriation occurs when&nbsp;things are considered weird or stupid on the people that they originated from, but&nbsp;deemed high fashion or edgy when the privileged take it for themselves.</p>

<p>With such a wide range of ethnicities and cultural backgrounds at Friends&nbsp;Academy, it is important to make sure that everyone in the community feels&nbsp;welcome and accepted for who they are. &nbsp;Certain costume choices make it almost&nbsp;impossible for everybody to feel comfortable during Halloween season at our&nbsp;school. &nbsp;Taking a traditional or sacred part of a&nbsp;culture&nbsp;and turning it into a costume is harmful and insensitive.</p>

<p>Examples of appropriation are everywhere in our society. &nbsp;Do you remember&nbsp;when everyone wore bindis, despite not being South Asian? &nbsp;Or the old&nbsp;trend when everybody would wear Native American headdresses to music festivals,&nbsp;with zero regard of the history or meaning behind it? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s cultural appropriation. &nbsp;These articles of clothing or accessories are not fun things to wear to Coachella. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re important and sacred to the people that created them. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s especially wrong&nbsp;because for many groups, practicing their culture leads to persecution and profiling. &nbsp;It is a double standard when they are then considered cute and interesting on other&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>This might not seem like an important&nbsp;issue in our society to you.&nbsp;But as a young, black&nbsp;girl, it is an issue which&nbsp;affects me directly. &nbsp;Seeing people dress up as a stereotype of your people and&nbsp;mock who you are is detrimental. &nbsp;It hurts your self-confidence and makes you feel&nbsp;like you are not an actual human being. &nbsp;If you spend your entire life seeing others&nbsp;treat you like a joke, you begin to feel like a joke. &nbsp;Even if malice is not intended, it is&nbsp;almost impossible to properly dress up as a group of people. People cannot be&nbsp;costumes. &nbsp;They are not all the same and they do not have an overall look that can be&nbsp;emulated.</p>

<p>People do not like to be stereotyped.</p>

<p>People do not like to be mocked. &nbsp;</p>

<p>People do not deserve to be treated like costumes.</p>

<p>In the end, whatever you are wearing is removable. &nbsp;You can take off the&nbsp;sombrero or the turban or the face makeup and go about your day, but the people&nbsp;that you are dressing up as live their lives forever. They cannot rid themselves of&nbsp;any negative or positive associations with who they are.</p>

<p>So, this Halloween, I encourage everyone to be mindful of how they affect&nbsp;others with their choices. &nbsp;It is important to be aware of the stereotypes that you&nbsp;perpetuate every time you treat a real group of people in our society as a costume. &nbsp;Costumes are meant to be funny or fictional. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t exist to offend or degrade. &nbsp;With that in mind, have a great Halloween!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dress code at Friends Academy is&nbsp;a subject of controversy every year. Despite efforts to promote Quaker values through a seemingly simple dress code, students and faculty alike often agree it does the opposite. In this piece, I would like to highlight just one particluar issue with the dress code, which is a product of the environment.&nbsp;At a high cost prep-school like this one, many&nbsp;students come from wealthy backrounds and their dress reflects this. Perhaps the intention of having such a business-like&nbsp;dress code is to reflect this&nbsp;wealth.&nbsp;The truth about high school is most students try desperately to fit in, especially with how they look.&nbsp;The standard of dress code at Friends&nbsp;leaves those from other backrounds or financial situations, struggling to dress in a way which keeps up with their classmates. To investigate this further I have put together a typical outfit&nbsp;worn by the average female student, and a typical outfit worn by the average male student. I have purposely limited&nbsp;my search to this gender binary, because&nbsp;they are simply the only two identites the school validates as legitimate in their dress code.</p>

<p><u>Female Outfit</u></p>

<p>1) Excursion Quilted Down&nbsp;Vest from J. Crew ($120.00)</p>

<p>Without including the price of the jewelry, the average outfit costs about $450.00. This is just for one day. Most girls rarely repeat outfits, indicating that to keep up with the norm one would need to have many outfits of this caliber. Including jewlery, which is not changed often, the price of the outfit is almost $11,000.00.</p>

<p>In total, the average male&#39;s outfit costs at least $541.50. Boys are not held to the same standards for outfit repeating as girls, but they still do not usually wear the same thing in one week. It is also important to note this does not include the blazer that male students are recquired to wear on Thursdays.</p>

<p>Looking at how much the average student spends on the outfits (the outfits I have seen worn most commonly), shows the exclusivity of expectation for dress-code norms.&nbsp;Although&nbsp;this is a hardship of only the minority of Friends students, it does not line up with the Quaker principles of simplicity and equality. A more lenient dress code would recquire articles of clothing which simply cost less than dress clothes do. In an effort to equalize the habits of dress, the school has isolated those unable to keep up financially.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

I think our&nbsp;dress code illuminates one of the biggest questions facing Friends: Who are we, and what do we really stand for?

The FA Student and Teacher Handbook states: &quot;The dress code at Friends Academy reflects respect for the traditions and mission of the school and the belief that members of the school community are engaged in a serious and important endeavor&quot;. &nbsp;I&#039;m not really sure what traditions this statement is referring to. As an institution whose mission is&nbsp;rooted in the Quaker testimonies, founded for &quot;the children of Friends and those similarly sentimented&quot;,&nbsp;how in any way does this dress code&nbsp;reflect the traditions and mission of our school? &nbsp;Almost all other Quaker schools across the country do not implement a dress code like this, and most Quakers, including our Quaker in Residence, agree that this standard does not adequately reflect Quaker values.

&nbsp;Furthermore, is it possible to be engaged in a &quot;serious and important endevour&quot; without a dress code? &nbsp;We insist on promoting the value of equality to our students, so what message our we sending to them&nbsp;by insisting that this kind of clothing must be worn to be taken seriously? &nbsp;Additionally, in honoring our testimony of equality, how in any way does this dress code promote equality amongst boys and girls? Not to mention, it does not even offer options for those who are gender nonconforming, nor even acknowledge the exhistence of those who are non-binary.

There are two very conflicting voices at Friends. &nbsp;At one end, we strive to be viewed as an elitist, rich-kid&nbsp;prep&nbsp;school, while at the other, pretend to uphold the Quaker testimonies. &nbsp;Bottom line -- these two sides just don&#039;t mix. &nbsp;You&#039;d just think that after 139 years we&#039;d have it figured out by now.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>How to Fit Community Service Into Your Life</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2015/10/17/how-to-fit-community-service-into-your-life/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why don&rsquo;t more students participate in the different forms of community service offered by the school? Many different types of community service are offered by W.A.T.C.H. at a variety of different times in order to make participating more accessible for students&mdash;so why aren&rsquo;t more people taking advantage of this? Is it because they don&rsquo;t feel the need to help the community, or because they are unaware that there is help needed within our community? Is it because they have too many other things going on outside of school? Is it because kids just want more free time? It seems as if the main issue is a terrible, daunting task: homework.</p>

<p>Students have a lot to do after school. Yes, the community service opportunities are offered at a range of times in order to make them available to more people, however, homework exists. Whether a student plays a sport, is in the play, or does something outside of school, homework poses a major obstacle; it is both extremely time consuming and extremely important. To put it simply, homework takes a lot of time to complete. If we were to be given less homework, would more people go to community service after school? Probably.</p>

<p>But sadly, as students, we have homework. So how can students still make time to go to community service? Plan ahead. If you realize you won&rsquo;t have a lot of homework on Thursday night, go to music therapy or art with friends. If you know you won&rsquo;t have much time throughout the week, go to sandwich making Wednesdays, which takes ten&nbsp;minutes. It&rsquo;s not hard to find ways to participate&mdash; you just have to try! When you think about it, homework is nowhere near as important as helping the community. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you participate in community service instead of doing your homework (I&rsquo;m really not suggesting that, that&rsquo;s not a good idea), however, I am suggesting that you try to find a way to fit in community service, even if it&rsquo;s just once a month.</p>

<p>It has also come to my attention that some people simply do not know exactly what community service is offered, and exactly what each option entails. Some students probably don&rsquo;t even realize that there is a need for help within our community. Here is a list of the community service options that FA offers, a brief description, and the time during which each takes place:</p>

<p>&bull; The Boys and Girls Club: help tutor young students with their homework<br />
	o When: 3:25-5pm Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday<br />
	o Where: meet in the library, then bus to Glen Cove Boys and Girls Cub<br />
	&bull; Music Therapy: play music with intellectually challenged men from the AHRC<br />
	o When: 3:30-4:45 Thursday<br />
	o Where: lower Dolan Center<br />
	&bull; Sports Night: play sports with kids from SCO<br />
	o When: 6-7pm Thursday<br />
	o Where: Field House<br />
	&bull; Art With Friends: make fun art projects with kids from SCO<br />
	o When: 4:00-4:45 Thursday<br />
	o Where: Art Studio<br />
	&bull; Sandwich Making: help make sandwiches to send<br />
	o When: 3:10-3:15 Wednesday<br />
	o Where: Commons</p>

		<title>What Does Your Handwriting Say About You?</title>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>What Does your Handwriting Say About You?</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">Everyone&#39;s handwriting is different, maybe it is neat with small letters, or large and illegible.&nbsp;Hand writing differs from person to person.&nbsp; You know how they say palm reading can give you a clue about your future? Well, your handwriting can give other people clues about your personality.&nbsp; Write on any piece of paper the well known pangram, &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot; &nbsp;Now&nbsp;you can analyze your handwriting. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>Size</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s start small.&nbsp; Having small hand writing indicates that you are shy, introverted, and you like to concentrate on studies rather than partying.&nbsp; If you feel something&#39;s dangerous, you&#39;re usually not interested.&nbsp; If your writing is larger than average means you&#39;re an extrovert, you&#39;re outgoing, and love to be the center of attention.&nbsp; That means that you can appear to have a lot of confidence.&nbsp; But, what if your handwriting size seems to be right in the middle of large and small?&nbsp; That&#39;s fine, your a cool person, and fairly reasonable.&nbsp; You have the ability to adapt to nearly anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>Legibility&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can everyone read your hand writing?&nbsp; Legibility of your hand writing also indicates traits of the personality.&nbsp; If everyone can read it then you&#39;re a confident person.&nbsp; You&#39;re simply happy to be you, there&#39;s no need for you to pretend to be somebody else.&nbsp; What if sometimes your handwriting is so messy that sometimes you can&#39;t even read your own?&nbsp; That means that you can be difficult to understand and your secrets are for you alone. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>Pressure</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you tend to write so hard that occasionally you poke a hole through your paper or do you write so faintly that your English teacher requests that you write in pen?&nbsp; Heavy writers, you&#39;re good when it comes to commitments and taking stuff seriously.&nbsp; Too much pressure in your writing means you&#39;re quick to react when it comes to criticism.&nbsp; Light writers tend to be sensitive and tend to show more empathy to others.&nbsp; However, this also means that you can have a lack of strength and energy. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>Shape of Letter</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you&#39;re letters rounded or more pointy?&nbsp; A good example is a capital &quot;A&quot;.&nbsp; Is the top curved or sharp like a shark tooth?&nbsp; Rounded and curved letters suggest you like to get creative.&nbsp; Art classes tend to be one of your more favorite classes in school.&nbsp; Pointed letters suggest that you like to fight for what you believe in.&nbsp; For example: &quot;We should have cookies everyday!&quot;&nbsp; You tend to be more&nbsp; aggressive and intense when it comes to getting your points across.&nbsp; Having sharp letters also indicates you are curious.&nbsp; You like to look behind the scenes and learn how stuff works. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>i</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Let&#39;s get into more specifics like the lowercase &quot;i&quot;.&nbsp; The dot of the &quot;i&quot; in your sentence, where is it and what does it look like?&nbsp; The positioning of the dot above the base also gives incite into your personality.&nbsp; High above the base indicates that you have a great imagination.&nbsp; Right above the the base indicates you are very organized and like to know the little details in a situation.&nbsp; To the left of the base means that you may be a procrastinator. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Enough about where the dot is, how about what the dot looks like?&nbsp; Maybe it isn&#39;t even a dot, maybe it is a slash, that means you are very critical of yourself, by setting high standards, and don&#39;t have you don&#39;t have much patience for people who never seem to learn from their mistakes.&nbsp; If the dot is a like a little &quot;o&quot; above the base that means you have a very child-like personality. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>t</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How about we take a break and look at &quot;t&quot;?&nbsp; That was a poor attempt at a pun.&nbsp; Where do you cross your t?&nbsp; There are two main positions where people like to cross their &quot;t&quot;, in the middle or towards the top.&nbsp; Having the cross at the top means you aim to be the top, you are a person who tends to find the bright sides of things and see the glass as half-full rather than half-empty.&nbsp; The cross in the middle indicates you&#39;re very confident and feel comfortable as just being yourself. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How long is the line across?&nbsp; If it&#39;s very long it means you are very enthusiastic but sometimes have a hard time letting things go.&nbsp; Short, little, crosses indicate you tend to be a little lazy. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><b>O</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#39;s one more letter I want to explain.&nbsp; That is the letter is &quot;o&quot;.&nbsp; If you leave your &quot;o&quot; open, it means your a very social person.&nbsp; It is easy for you to discuss your feelings and tend to not have many secrets that you keep to yourself.&nbsp; Having a closed &quot;o&quot; indicates that tend to not be so open about your personal feelings, probably only sharing your secrets with a lucky few. &nbsp;</span></p>

		<title>The Double Standard of Innocence</title>

<p><em>*Author&rsquo;s Note: This article focuses on the experiences of women because the author is a female, and so has direct experience with that perspective. This is not intended to say that men do not also suffer from related issues, but that this specific problem is primarily felt by women. &nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The dictionary defines innocence as&nbsp;&ldquo;freedom from sin or moral wrong; harmlessness.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the traditional meaning of the word. Society has created a second meaning; An &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; girl is one who is not sexually active. This second definition is incredibly prevalent in school communities, like Friends Academy; Female students that are not perceived to be sexually active are seen as innocent and good.</p>

<p>Why is a woman&#39;s worth so directly tied to whether or not they are sexually active? And why is a woman who is not&nbsp;sexually active seen as superior to one who is? These misguided and outdated beliefs likely stem from a variety of issues, such as a lack of comprehensive sexual education in high schools, and&nbsp;media sources that reinforce the idea that women who are sexually active are &ldquo;sluts.&rdquo; But it boils down to the fact that society as a whole continues to maintain that sex is bad&hellip;if it is&nbsp;a <strong>woman </strong>who is sexually active.</p>

<p>The cold, hard truth is that a woman owning or&nbsp;even<i>...&nbsp;</i>being proud of her sexuality <em>*gasp*</em> &nbsp;scares people. Women who engage in consensual sex, especially while in high school, often get a reputation among their peers as &ldquo;slutty&rdquo; or &ldquo;promiscuous;&rdquo; Yet, men who are sexually active are applauded for their actions. Furthermore, women are encouraged to retain their virginity and remain &ldquo;innocent&rdquo;, whereas men are applauded for losing their. Why are women shamed for doing the same things that men do? Why do we still buy into this horrifyingly sexist double standard?</p>

<p>As a society we should be striving to be progressive-&nbsp;to be fair.&nbsp;We have taken steps in this direction. But no society can honestly call itself progressive while it still enforces this double standard for men and women. Unfortunately, these sexist beliefs are so deeply ingrained in our culture that we do not notice even when it affects our behavior. We give women this ideal of innocence to strive for, in order to be seen as &ldquo;good.&rdquo; In this way, society reinforces the harmful notion that women should be ashamed of their sexuality.</p>

<p>Innocence itself is not the criminal here. It is a word, and a word has only the power that we choose to give it. But this word is far too often used to praise women who are not sexually active, helping society to maintain a sexist double standard. Someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; should not be based on whether are not that person is sexually active. All women should be respected, regardless of their perceived &ldquo;innocence.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>What You Need to Know About the 2015 PSAT</title>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Wednesday, October 14<sup>th</sup>, Friends Academy sophomores and juniors took the PSAT, a College Board-affiliated test taken by high school students across the country. The test ran from approximately 8:30 to 11:30 in the morning, with all sophomore and junior classes during this period cancelled in light of the test. Students were given a full-length practice PSAT test to take home, as well as a booklet containing general test information and skills practice in the weeks prior to the test by their advisors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The PSAT, which stands for the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, has two main functions: to prepare juniors for the actual SAT and also to provide potential awards and distinctions to juniors who score high enough to earn a National Merit Scholarship- either Finalist or Semifinalist. Only juniors are eligible for the National Merit Scholarship program, but sophomores can take the test if their school allows them to do so. At Friends, all sophomores are required to take the test, a policy that has been implemented with idea that more practice will be beneficial and can be an asset in the planning of students&rsquo; future test-taking. Because the PSAT is also supposed to predict approximate SAT scores, many student advisors encourage students to take PSAT scores into consideration when choosing whether to take the SAT or the ACT their junior year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PSAT scores do not have any direct bearing upon college applications. In other words, PSAT scores are not directly given to colleges. However, earning a Semifinalist or Finalist badge is a great distinction, and can be added to one&rsquo;s college application or resume as an impressive supplement. Additionally, semifinalists and finalists have the opportunity to obtain a variety of scholarships from the organization and other college programs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conjunction with the release of the new SAT this coming March, the College Board also redesigned the October 2015 PSAT so that it would accurately reflect the format of the new SAT. Since this was the first year that such changes had been implemented, there was not much of a history to draw upon as to the redesigned test for student preparation. Many students have expressed apprehensions about having less practice material available and thus having lower scores. However, it is important to remember that the PSAT is graded on a national curve- that is, it will be scored according to how well all students across the nation did. As junior Jacqueline Walzer stated: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important for students not to worry too much about getting low PSAT scores. Since everyone has less material to prepare from and the test is graded based on everyone&rsquo;s scores, rather than set numbers, the only thing that matters is how well you do relative to others in the country.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>Mrs. Schoman&#039;s Transition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">As<b>&nbsp;</b>most now know<b>, </b>Mrs. Deb Schoman departed&nbsp;from the upper school last year and entered&nbsp;ou<b>r </b>middle school to serve as principal.<b> </b>I had the honor of speaking<b>&nbsp;</b>with&nbsp;Mrs. Schoman about her past&nbsp;and this exciting transtion.&nbsp;This year, Mrs. Schoman will be celebrating her 40th year in education! Her passion for education began at Harborfields Junior/ Senior High School (her alma mater), teaching French in 1975. &nbsp;She grew&nbsp;up in Centerport, Long Island.&nbsp;In college, Mrs. Schoman majored in French, minored in Spanish, and even lived abroad &ldquo;to become proficient in French and develop an appreciation for the culture of the people and the country&rdquo;. Abroad, she attended the University of Nechatel and worked in vineyards to earn some money for school expenses and travel. &nbsp;Mrs. Schoman vividly recollects spending a month studying in Madrid and another six months studying at the University of Grenoble in France while living with a French family<b>. S</b>he remarks &ldquo;I must say- these years of living abroad were my most memorable and made me a better teacher and person&rdquo;. She&nbsp;taught French in public schools for seven years, until&nbsp;discovering Friends in 1981.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;headmaster at the time, Ted Withington, offered Mrs. Schoman a position and she&nbsp;soon began teaching French, Spanish, and Introductory Latin in the middle school, along with coaching the girl&rsquo;s varsity tennis in the upper school and later assisting with the girl&rsquo;s varsity track team. In fact, Mrs. Schoman was my moms tennis coach, when she attended Friends in high school! &nbsp;Eventually, she was encouraged to move into the administration. Her first administrative position&nbsp;was Seventh Grade Team Leader. Her&nbsp;position soon progressed to&nbsp;Assistant Principal, and finally to Principal of the middle school, where she remained&nbsp;until 2004. &nbsp;After taking the position of &ldquo;Interim&rdquo; Upper School Principal in 2004, she held the position through last year. &nbsp;Speaking of this, Mrs. Schoman admits, &ldquo;I truly enjoyed my 10 years run in the Upper School- working with faculty on cirriculum and program development, helping students navigate the challenging years that prepare them for college and feeling enormous pride watching them recieve their diplomas in June&rdquo;. In the spring of last year,&nbsp;at the announcement of middle school principal Rubenacker&rsquo;s leave for Florida, Schoman expresses how her&nbsp;&ldquo;...&nbsp;heart said &lsquo;Go back to your roots&rsquo; It was time!&rdquo;. &nbsp;Mrs. Schoman expresses how transition has been fabulous, and&nbsp;she is&nbsp;very appreciative for exposure to the energy of her st<b>u</b>dents. She has enjoyed her overall &ldquo;return debut&rdquo; to the middle school. Finally, Mrs. Schoman comments &ldquo;While many would rather forget thier middle school years, my hope is that this is not true at FA&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">As for family, Mrs. Schoman has two children- Matt, age 29, living in Connecticut and a leading Engineer at General Dynamic/Electric Boat, along with Victora, age 26, an Occupational Therapist in Florida. &nbsp;Her husband Jeff, and her, take pleasure in skiing, boating, and &ldquo;toddling around on our 1919 American LaFrance fire truck&rdquo;. Make sure to wave a quick hello and catch up with Mrs. Schoman, whenever you have a chance!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. The &quot;line-up&quot; in audtions that makes no sense to you as a freshman but is very important when you&#39;re a senior.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/trust-me-it-s-very-important.png"><img alt="trust-me-it-s-very-important" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4622" height="300" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/trust-me-it-s-very-important-257x300.png" width="257" /></a></p>

<p>2. &quot;The cast list will be up by noon&quot; never means it will be up at noon, but that won&#39;t stop you&nbsp;running to the Dolan Center to check.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_niar5k0LGy1u870muo1_250.gif"><img alt="tumblr_niar5k0LGy1u870muo1_250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4623" height="250" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_niar5k0LGy1u870muo1_250.gif" width="250" /></a></p>

<p>3. Slightly dreading the first Saturday rehearsal...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4.gif"><img alt="4" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4641" height="158" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-300x158.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>4. But, after getting through the whole eight hours, you realized you actually kind of enjoyed it</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/giphy-facebook_s.gif"><img alt="giphy-facebook_s" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4625" height="169" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/giphy-facebook_s-300x169.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>5. The moment you realize the cast is now your family</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/giphy.gif"><img alt="giphy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4629" height="156" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/giphy-300x156.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>6. Knowing that US Conferences mean a 10-hour rehearsal...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/joy.gif"><img alt="joy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4640" height="153" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/joy-300x153.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>7. The feeling of dread that you experience on the&nbsp;Sunday before show week begins</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fd0c69846811c386e9cbcb5f26651f5b.gif"><img alt="fd0c69846811c386e9cbcb5f26651f5b" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4626" height="120" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fd0c69846811c386e9cbcb5f26651f5b-300x120.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>8. There is nothing like stuffing your face in the green room before dress rehearsals</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/anigif_enhanced-buzz-11459-1379702796-0.gif"><img alt="anigif_enhanced-buzz-11459-1379702796-0" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4627" height="150" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/anigif_enhanced-buzz-11459-1379702796-0-300x150.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>9. When you just do not have enough time for sleep during show week...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_maj8k0yrhk1qih9gi.gif"><img alt="tumblr_maj8k0yrhk1qih9gi" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4628" height="211" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_maj8k0yrhk1qih9gi-300x211.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>10. Cast circle before opening night is VERY emotional</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_inline_mpxbec64pH1qz4rgp.gif"><img alt="tumblr_inline_mpxbec64pH1qz4rgp" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4630" height="129" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_inline_mpxbec64pH1qz4rgp-300x129.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>11. Walking to places on opening night...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_njxsvf6ZbN1t2bkw1o3_500.jpg"><img alt="tumblr_njxsvf6ZbN1t2bkw1o3_500" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4631" height="300" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_njxsvf6ZbN1t2bkw1o3_500-218x300.jpg" width="218" /></a></p>

<p>12. While yelling the Wildcat cheer (that the audience can almost definitely hear from their seats)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/beccd0eee2890109f3f98a52df7b1a7c.gif"><img alt="beccd0eee2890109f3f98a52df7b1a7c" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4632" height="169" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/beccd0eee2890109f3f98a52df7b1a7c-300x169.gif" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>13. But, in spite of everything, you wouldn&#39;t want to be doing anything else.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/images.jpg"><img alt="images" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4633" height="168" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/images-300x168.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Writing Fellows program has existed for many years, but took a new form this year. The new Writing Center is located on the third level of the library, and anyone can schedule and appointment with a Writing Fellow (via the FA portal), or just stop in to get help. The goal of the writing center is to help students with their writing process by engaging them in conversation. According to Head of the English Department, Doctor Garrett, the Writing Center is part of the &ldquo;20 or 30 year trend towards learning how to teach people how to write.&rdquo; Doc Garrett continued to explain that &ldquo;research on how to teach writing shows it provokes anxiety,&rdquo; and that therefore the goal of the Writing Center is to teach students to &ldquo;practice it as a craft.&rdquo; Writing should not be stressful, it should be interesting, and as Doc Garrett emphasized, talking through an assignment with someone can really help you get your ideas straight. Mr. Wetherall is the new head of Writing Fellows, and he also had a lot to say about the new Writing Center. His answers to the questions below give a lot of detail as to what the writing center is, and how it can help students:</p>

<p>How would you briefly describe the Writing Center?</p>

<p>Mr Wetherall: The Writing Center has been successful, and it becomes more successful each week. Word of mouth seems to be our best advertisement. At the beginning of the year, few students were making appointments. But after the first few students left their appointments and told friends how helpful the Writing Center was, we became much busier.</p>

<p>In your opinion, has the new style of the Writing Center been successful thus far?</p>

<p>Mr. Wetherall: The Writing Center is already getting busier. However, it&#39;s only realistic to recognize that some times of the school year will be busier than others: the end of each quarter, for example, or when research papers are due. At present, we can handle between twenty and twenty-five appointments per week. That is a lot, but we would welcome the challenge of expanding our current schedule.</p>

<p>What do you foresee in the future for the Writing Center? Do you think that it will get busier throughout the year?</p>

<p>Mr. Wetherall: We have considered making the Writing Center available to middle school students at some point in the future. The Writing Center and its staff combat inequity and uphold academic integrity by offering a sanctioned form of free tutoring, and the middle school shares these values and concerns as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, why should students use the Writing Center?</p>

<p>Mr. Wetherall: Students should use the Writing Center because every writer needs a reader.</p>

<p>Whether you only have an outline or have a full paper that needs proofreading, the Writing Center can help. Appointments can be made through the FA Portal, or you can just stop in during your free block to ask questions.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a 20-14 win over Mineola, the Friends Academy football team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 2000. It was a big moment for the football program as well as the entire community. The team finished with an impressive record of 5-3, which was enough to clinch the playoff berth, as well as many individual players having great seasons. Quarterback Corey Goldglit finished with an impressive 998 passing yards on the season as well as 404 rushing yards in addition to 19 total touchdowns. Jalijah Daniels finished with 7 total touchdowns and JD Baptiste finished the season with 5. The team&rsquo;s captains this year were seniors Jalijah Daniels, Corey Goldglit, Nate Tyson, and Max Sutherland. Friends Academy finished in 7th place in the conference and will face Seaford in a playoff game on Saturday November 7th. The Quakers finished their season on an impressive 2 game win streak cementing themselves as a legitimate contender to knock off some teams in the playoffs. The team&rsquo;s fight and desire to win games is admirable and they made the entire community proud. That is why the football team has won the honor of the top sports moment of the fall.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the winter is coming, certain things come with it.&nbsp;You may be thinking of those fluffy uggs sitting in your closet or that puffy winter coat, but what we thought of was soup.&nbsp;Soup is the perfect food for&nbsp;any day and will definitely warm you up on a cold one.&nbsp;How could you walk through the lunchroom and ignore&nbsp;the wide variety of soups offered? We decided to try the three most popular soups offered this Novemeber&nbsp;and share our reviews.&nbsp;If you have any opinions to add, please let us know.&nbsp;Make sure you take advantage of this soup; you never know what you got till it&#39;s gone.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Rate: 2/10&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Too sour. Lacks sweetness. Tastes like a pickle. After taste of a lemon. Steer clear if you&#39;re not into a&nbsp;hot pickle taste.&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">The popular burrito chain has been recieving so much shade after the&nbsp;life-threatening E. Coli outbreak linked to their restaurants. We&#39;re talking 40 cases of E. Coli in the Northwest&nbsp;linked to Chipotle. Ever since, the company says they have been doing deep cleaning, testing, and replacing of the&nbsp;food. They&#39;ve also hired food consultants to keep an eye on their food saftey. These precautions are most definitely necessary, considering the Chiptole has been overwhemed with negative publicity&nbsp;in the past week. Furthermore, shares of Chipotle&nbsp;have dropped 2.5% to $624.00 on Monday, right after the company closed restaurants in Washington and Oregon as it investigated the source of the outbreak. After their investigation, the E. Coli was traced back to meals purchased from the restaurants in the metro Portland area and many counties in Washington, infecting more than 22 poeple. However,&nbsp;a spokeswoman of the Washington state Department of Health states&nbsp;the cause of the outbreak is still considered inconcluded. My prayers are with the company in this moment of confusion and dispair.&nbsp;Let&#39;s hope that this matter is taken care of immediately. I miss my &#39;potle bowls.&nbsp;</p>

		<title>Are AP Classes Worth It?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Friends Academy, it&rsquo;s easy to feel like you HAVE to take AP classes. These Advanced Placement classes are college-level, designed to challenge students more than a normal high school course would. The question is, are AP classes, and the stress that so often comes with them, worth it?</p>

<p>The answer to that question is different for each student. Students who are choosing an advanced class because they have a strong internal drive to push themselves further in a particular subject area and are genuinely interested in the material are less likely to feel stressed or anxious about the course load. When the motivation comes from within, and the decision isn&rsquo;t being influenced by fears or pressure, it is certainly going to be easier to follow through on the work. For these students, an AP course would make sense for them. Denise Pope, a senior lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School, sums it up best: &ldquo;If you are truly interested in the subject&hellip;then you&#39;re probably going to have a good experience from taking a more advanced class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then continues to point out that, for other students, taking an AP might not be the best choice: &ldquo;If you&#39;re pushed into it without good preparation and without a safety net in place at the school to help you if you get in over your head, then it may be more harmful than helpful.&rdquo; For students who feel immense pressure to take these classes, either from themselves, their teachers, their parents or from the college process, taking an AP can feel like something they have to do. When their motivation comes from anxiety and fear, and not from genuine interest in a subject, the coursework will only add to that already-present stress.</p>

<p>The question of whether or not AP classes are worth it really boils down to, are you willing and able to put in the work that the class requires? Can you devote the necessary time? And, most importantly, are you genuinely interested in the subject material? If you answer these questions honestly with a &lsquo;no&rsquo;, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you aren&rsquo;t smart or intelligent. It means you are putting yourself first. Additionally, answering that question with a &lsquo;no&rsquo; for one AP, like AP Physics, doesn&rsquo;t mean that no AP will fit with your learning style and abilities. There are APs in every subject, so if you aren&rsquo;t comfortable with science, but you love history, you can find advanced courses in something that will actually interest you.</p>

<p>Taking as many APs as you can fit in your schedule is not worth it if it means sacrificing your mental health and well-being. In schools like Friends Academy, where students are held to high expectations, it&rsquo;s easy to feel inadequate if you aren&rsquo;t taking a lot of APs while&nbsp;your peers are. But the number of APs you take does not define your success as a student, and pushing yourself beyond your limits might only hurt you in the long run. So, its up to you to ask yourself: Are AP classes worth it?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://sev.h-cdn.co/assets/15/12/1426865664-terre-des-femmes-womans-worth-ad-campaign-2.jpg" style="width: 440px; height: 623px;" />Sex, Sluts, and Pizza: The perfect equation for the Gender Progression discussion on slut-shaming.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t know, slut-shaming is the degradation of a person, usually a woman, for their sexual history and experiences.&nbsp; Due to slut-shaming&rsquo;s gendered nature and the effect that it has on everybody in our society, it was the perfect topic for Gender Progression&rsquo;s first lunch and learn this year.</p>

<p>The lunch and learn began with a video of a women attempting to discover what a slut really is, and in her pursuit she discovered that it does not exist.&nbsp; Every person that she asked had a different depiction of what a slut is and absolutely no idea how to back up their claims.&nbsp; This video jump-started the discussion.&nbsp; Students had different ideas about why slut-shaming occurs and how to combat it in our school.&nbsp; Some students thought that slut-shaming is a universal problem that can only be destroyed by teaching people to care less about sex.&nbsp; Others believed that slut-shaming could be attacked by desensitizing people to the word; reclaiming the word &ldquo;slut&rdquo; and turning it into a word with no negative connotations will end slut-shaming.&nbsp; Despite different opinions on how to end body policing and slut-shaming, there <em>was</em> a general consensus on why the epidemic occurs.&nbsp; Slut-shaming is a way to force people, typically women, into suppressing their sexuality and being afraid to own their bodies.</p>

<p>Slut-shaming isn&rsquo;t only a tool to stop people from embracing their sexuality.&nbsp; It is also a way to skew the meaning of sex for so many people.&nbsp; The existence of body-policing affects everybody.&nbsp; Young girls are convinced that the number of times that they have had sex determines their purity and young men are tricked into believing that their number of sexual partners determines their manliness.&nbsp; So considering body policing&rsquo;s influence on a large number of people, it&rsquo;s interesting that the lunch and learn was met with some shock and discomfort.</p>

<p>Many people were excited to talk about slut-shaming as it is something that a lot of teenagers have experienced, but some people were uncomfortable and thought that the usage of the world &ldquo;slut&rdquo; was controversial and weird.&nbsp; Despite the fact that many people in our community openly use words such as &ldquo;slut&rdquo;, &ldquo;whore, &ldquo;prude&rdquo; et cetera, they did not feel comfortable with the words being said publicly with the intent to end body policing.&nbsp; But no matter what your opinion on the use of these words is, the fact still stands that slut-shaming is wrong.&nbsp; It is not our right as human beings to tell other people what they can do with their own bodies.</p>

<p>The Gender Progression lunch and learn on slut-shaming was a success.&nbsp; Ideas were shared and different perspectives were heard.&nbsp;It is clear that our community is one of acceptance and love, but we still have a long way to go.&nbsp; The lunch and learn has just opened the door to further conversations; it&rsquo;s our responsibility to act on this opportunity.</p>

		<title>Blackberry vs. iPhone Showdown</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2011/11/24/blackberry-vs-iphone-showdown/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am the owner of a two-year old Blackberry Torch, and I am due for a new phone.  I have been thinking about switching from my Blackberry to the iPhone, and it has not been an easy decision for me. After doing some research I think I have found the better phone. <a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/DSCN0005.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-633" title="DSCN0005" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/DSCN0005-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="341" height="222" /></a>

One of the main reasons I have held off buying an iPhone was that I had been worried that I would not be able to text or type quickly enough. The iPhone has a touch screen keypad, while the Blackberry has a keypad with raised keys. After trying to send an email from my friend’s iPhone, I made many errors and it took me a lot longer than it would have on my Blackberry. Another advantage to owning a Blackberry, is free texting with any other Blackberry owner, otherwise known as BBM. Because texting has become so pricey these days, this was a particularly attractive feature that led me to purchase my Blackberry in the first place. Even though these two features are very important to me and would heavily influence me to purchase a new Blackberry, the iPhone has many unique capabilities.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/DSCN0014.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-634" title="DSCN0014" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/DSCN0014-1024x1013.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="187" /></a>

Being a music lover, I find it extremely frustrating that it is so difficult to get music on my Blackberry. With the iPhone, everything you need is on the phone; you can download music anywhere. The newest iPhone, the iPhone 4s, has made searching the web a once tedious and time-consuming activity on the Blackberry, extremely simple. If there is anything that you want to search, all you have to do is give the iPhone a simple command, and in the blink of an eye, you get exactly what you asked for. The iPhone’s claim to fame is its app store, which gives every iPhone user access to over 500,000 apps. Two of the most popular apps are Shazam, a song-identifying app, and Angry Birds an entertaining game and a perfect time waster. Another app that would be especially helpful to FA students is Reed Rosenbluth’s FA schedule app. This app allows every FA student to accesses his/her schedule from his/her iPhone.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/DSCN0009.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-635" title="DSCN0009" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/DSCN0009-1024x805.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="212" /></a>

Recently, I spoke with a few FA students and it is clear that more of them prefer iPhones. The students like the music, games and love the fact that they can use their phone as a planner.

Although it will be difficult to adjust to the new keypad and give up free texting, I think it is worth making the switch because of the myriad of advantages and entertaining features on the iPhone.

		<title>Quora: whats your opinion?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Quora is a fun and helpful website that facilitates discussion on everything from popular culture and entertainment to science and new inventions. You may be wondering how using this website can be more beneficial than simply searching Google. Because the website focuses on opinion rather than fact, users are able to get the opinions of people knowledgable of the subject about which they might inquire. The site differs from other Q&amp;A forums in that its users tend to both ask interesting and legitimate questions and receive interesting and legitimate answers.

For example, My friend Kyle once asked a question about how the company Pulse News marketed their iPhone app, after reading that they did little to no marketing for their iPad app. He was surprised to find that he got an amazing response from the marketing director at pulse. Interactions like this are not unusual on Quora.

On top of Quora being a great source for answers and information, it can also be used as a social website. Quora allows you to create a profile, where you can post personal information and even pictures. Through Quora you can also message other users, friends as well as people you have never met. Sign onto Quora, and have your questions answered!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Do you want a Food-ucation?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're trying to change your eating habits and create an easy and accessible diet with less additives and better ingredients, these three apps may be very helpful to you.

<strong>GoodFoodNearYou- </strong> this app identifies the users location by using GPS, where it then sorts through all of the menus at restaurants fairly close to you. The app can identify how many grams of fat, calories and carbs in any one of the items from any of the menus. Not only is this app helpful to those unfamiliar with their location, but it is also extremely helpful to those who are unsure of the restaurant and the way that, that restaurant prepares its food.

<a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/goodfoodnearyou.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1400" title="goodfoodnearyou" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/goodfoodnearyou.jpg" alt="" width="112" height="162" /></a>

<strong>Fooducate – </strong>the main focus of Fooducate is to give different types and brands of foods letter grades. These grades are based on both the opinion and research of dietitians as well as the users of this apps feedback option.  This app allows you to scan the barcode of a food product, where the app will then give you the grade of that product, as well as a list of all of the ingredients in that product.Often times just glancing at the label and package of a food can be deceiving. Due to marketing techniques used to trick consumers you may think that the food you are purchasing is healthy; while, in reality this "healthy" product may contain many unhealthy ingredients like high fructose corn syrup.

<img class="wp-image-1401 alignnone" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="fooducate" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fooducate.jpg" alt="" width="95" height="69" />

<strong>Loc</strong><strong>avore- </strong>this app guides you to places with locally produced and grown food; this includes farms and farmers markets. The app then highlights which fruits and vegetables are in season in your area, as well as provide recipes containing these certain food products. Not only does this app help you learn new recipes and get fresh and in season ingredients, but it also encourages and supports sustainability.

<p>Every year, in the days preceding Thanksgiving break, the Friends Academy junior class embarks on a highly anticipated trip to the nation&rsquo;s capital, Washington, D.C. The purpose of the trip is partly to supplement students&rsquo; learning in their U.S. History and American Literature courses, and partly to enhance community bonding through the class retreat. Junior class administrators officially announced the trip&rsquo;s dates to the grade on the very first day of the 2015-2016 school year, describing it as one of the highlights of junior year, a statement many students agreed with. Students have expressed varying levels of excitement towards the trip, but a majority of them lean towards a high level of enthusiasm, with some students even considering the trip to be the most important experience of their entire Friends Academy career.</p>

<p>The juniors were supposed to depart early in the morning on Sunday, November 22<sup>nd</sup> and return to school around 3:00 pm on Tuesday, November 24<sup>th</sup>. But in the days leading up to the trip, Head of School Bill Morris received calls from several parents who were concerned about their children being in D.C. just ten days after the events surrounding ISIS and the Paris attacks. The administration organized a faculty meeting in order to decide whether or not to proceed with the trip. Ultimately, the decision was made to cancel and tentatively postpone the trip to a later date. In an email sent out to junior class members and parents, Mr. Morris wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We recognize that this trip has both educational and community building value for each class, so we want to provide the opportunity for the Class of 2017 to have this experience if the timing is such that the participants can focus on the trip and not their concerns. Our decision is based on the one reality we know for sure &ndash; that students, parents, and faculty are following the events abroad and the recent stated ISIS threats and are expressing fears and concerns about travelling to Washington at this time.&nbsp; Knowing the widespread level of unease in our community, we feel that, in these circumstances, we could not reach the educational and community building goals of the trip.&nbsp; We need to acknowledge everyone&rsquo;s current state of mind, allow for settling of emotions and concerns, and hopefully proceed with the trip in 3 &frac12; months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cancellation has provoked various reactions from members of the junior class. Daniel McCooey, one student who had been extremely excited about the trip, said: &ldquo;I think ISIS&rsquo; objective is to get us to be scared of them, and that&rsquo;s kind of what we are doing, which is ridiculous. I understand [the concerns] and I&rsquo;m not mad at the school, but I&rsquo;m frustrated that the school had to cancel it because of a few people&rsquo;s parents. The problem is that the whole grade doesn&rsquo;t get to experience the trip. But at the same time it does make sense that [if we go], then the entirety of the junior grade will not be able to share in this great experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Student Joseph Como had also been looking forward to the experience, but was doubtful that the tentative plans to reschedule would come to fruition. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame that a few overprotective parents are ruining my trip. I think this cancellation is proof that there won&rsquo;t be a trip at all because a communal sense of safety won&rsquo;t grow in the next couple months. Things will stay the same,&rdquo; said Como.</p>

<p>Two students, Daniella Auerbach and Jacob Rush, both conveyed their skepticism as to the possibility of an ISIS attack while students were in D.C. In Auerbach&rsquo;s opinion, &ldquo;The safest time to go is actually right now. If people are worried about being attacked in D.C., they have nothing to worry about because the security is so high and the whole city is on lockdown.&rdquo; Similarly, Rush stated, &ldquo;D.C. is always receiving terrorist threats&hellip; But the only time that D.C. has actually been bombed was in 9/11&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there was a serious threat but I understand why people were concerned,&rdquo; said Brooke Juhel, another junior class member.</p>

<p>Student Kaitlyn Hardy recounted her initial reaction when she found out the trip had been cancelled. &ldquo;I was extremely upset that it had been cancelled because I really wanted to go&hellip; But the administration&rsquo;s concerns were valid because they wanted to be safe with the decisions they made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>English teacher Dr. Katy Howard agrees with the administration&rsquo;s decision to postpone the trip until a later date despite overall student disappointment with the outcome.&nbsp;&ldquo;The feeling of being responsible for children is one that is hard to understand unless you are in that position yourself,&rdquo; Howard told students in one of her English classes. Ultimately, the administration had to feel safe about their actions.</p>

		<title>Can the &#039;Walk of Shame&#039; Ever Become the &#039;Walk of NO Shame?&#039;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[embed]https://flic.kr/p/as1iZn[/embed]</p>

<p>Here are my&nbsp;extensive thoughts after&nbsp;last week&#39;s lunch-and-learn:</p>

<p>First, let me define double standard. According to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double%20standard">Merriam-Webster</a>, it is &ldquo;a situation in which two people, groups, etc., are treated very differently from each other in a way that is unfair to one of them.&rdquo; Allow me to cut to the chase here: double standards are always demonstrated between&nbsp;males and females. Personally, I fail to allow any fictitious reasoning to deceive me of what I know to be true: there is no justification in the discrepancies between genders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I suppose one can argue that history substantiates gender differences and that the polarity between male and female may have been encouraged at an early age. However, we are in the 21st century. Not to mention, the <i>dawn</i> of the 21st century. We are setting the tone for the succeeding years of our future, our children&rsquo;s future, and I believe that it is unavailing to abide by these gender roles for any longer. But that&rsquo;s just my opinion. Frankly, I am blinded as to why one is hesitant to agree with me. The only thing I would ever request of someone to have is an open mind. This world &mdash; where beliefs are prejudiced, perspectives are unalterable, and people are bigoted &mdash; is inevitably going to create hardships for everyone. But, in particular, the hardships for women happen to be just a little bit, well, harder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to travel many places in our world: Italy, France, England, etc. But, there&rsquo;s no place like the North Shore of Long Island if I want to witness the bad-mouthing against high school girls and whatever their sexual activity is. Yep, I have front row seats and it didn&rsquo;t cost me a thing.</p>

<p>What elicited my thoughts about this reoccurring trend to bash girls and their biological nature, was last week&rsquo;s lunch-and-learn. Hosted by the Gender Progression Club, the lunch-and-learn was open to students and faculty to discuss&hellip; &ldquo;slut-shaming.&rdquo; Yes, I did use the word &ldquo;slut.&rdquo; I agree, it is vulgar. But, I won&rsquo;t shy away from utilizing it because it needs to be discussed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This brings me to my first question. Why do people grow so uncomfortable at the public use of this word, especially if it&rsquo;s frequently used surreptitiously? I believe it is healthy to verbalize the controversies of this word, and the conversation around&nbsp;sex that follows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michel Foucault&mdash;one of the most prominent philosophers of the 20th century&mdash; encouraged a discourse on sex. In <i>The History of Sexuality</i>,<i> </i>published in 1976, Foucault states:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One had to speak of sex; one had to speak publicly and in a manner that was not&nbsp;determined by the division&nbsp;between licit and illicit &hellip; one had to speak of it as of a thing&nbsp;to be not simply condemned or tolerated but managed, inserted into systems of utility, regulated for the greater good of all, made to function according to an optimum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, everyone, let&rsquo;s speak about the unspoken. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to shy away from conversation because you&#39;re unsure if it&rsquo;s right or wrong to speak of. I, personally, grew up with&nbsp;hesitation about&nbsp;discussing sex. It wasn&rsquo;t because I was taught that a conversation on sex was particularly bad, it was because there wasn&rsquo;t any conversation on sex- which led me to misinterpret its connotation. Foucault wants nothing more than for us to break down these walls, build on timidness, and talk about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this lunch-and-learn, students were asked what they would define a &ldquo;slut&rdquo; as. These were some of the responses:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;A girl who has sex without any emotional connection.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Someone who wears skimpy, revealing clothes or dresses.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Has more than a few sexual partners.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Only cares about sex, nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Always hanging around only the guys.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was taken aback by the amount of variation in the responses. The students didn&rsquo;t really know what they were defining. And once another peer answered the question with a different definition, I could see the self-doubt in the preceding student who had just answered. They all agreed, though, that this word has a negative connotation. This is why everyone seems to be apprehensive to use it in a formal setting. But this word also seems to be undefinable. Perhaps because the word&rsquo;s meaning is continually evolving over the years due its frequent overuse.</p>

<p>Furthermore, teachers at the lunch-and-learn were surprised. They didn&rsquo;t know that this word is so commonly used amongst high school students in such a casual manner. They recalled that they never came near the use of this word when they were teenagers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That being said, why is it that people of my generation seem to use the word &ldquo;slut,&rdquo; without any hesitation or forethought of its effect? Why is it so overused and easily used?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the only answer I have: the answers may vary. The ambiguity is so dissatisfying, I know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This hackneyed word in today&rsquo;s vernacular has lead to yet another term you must be up-to-date with: slut-shaming. <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Slut_shaming">Geek Feminism</a> defines it as &ldquo;the act of criticizing a woman for her real or presumed sexual activity, or for behaving in ways that someone thinks are associated with her real or presumed sexual activity.&rdquo; I guess if you have the audacity to call someone a &ldquo;slut,&rdquo; you&#39;re basically bashing them for owning their sexuality. Interesting. But, here&rsquo;s why I get irritated: why isn&rsquo;t a guy ever criticized for his sexual activity?&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, observe the classic procedure: his rowdy friends encourage him to get with as many girls possible at the party and he doesn&rsquo;t back down from the challenge. He feels the need to execute this duty, but, why? To meet the standards of others? To fulfill expectations? To boost his ego? Whatever it is, I don&rsquo;t care. Because in that same night, if a woman becomes sexually&nbsp;adventurous, she is the only one who is going to be spoken about the next morning. The only one who is going to be &ldquo;slut-shamed.&rdquo; What did she do wrong to receive these attacks? What did the guy <i>not </i>do wrong to receive no negative commentary?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t have the answers. But, how could I? All I know is that men and women&nbsp;explore their sexuality in a similar manner, but the consequences are far from similar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slut&rdquo; is a gendered term. The last time I checked, there&rsquo;s no word in the English language burdening men for their sexual affairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Double standards, people.</p>

<p>Sexism.</p>

<p>The worst part is, the male in this scenario usually exhibits enough hubris to &ldquo;slut-shame&rdquo; the girl the most. Is it out of spite? To gain control over the situation? I believe this action is paralleled to the proverbial, historic need for men to apparently crave dominance. By calling her a slut, he feels as if he&rsquo;s putting her in her place, reverting the power back to himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forgive me, but, who gives the right to a man to call a woman a slut? No one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, girls&mdash; we&rsquo;re not off the hook either. Primarily, I never understood why girls slut-shame other girls. News flash: we&rsquo;re all cruising on the same boat, females. And when we hit turbulence elicited by someone&rsquo;s ignorance, we are going to need each other for support, not judgement. Secondly, if we stop easily dispensing this word, we can stop implying that it&rsquo;s okay for men to use it as well. Yes, that&rsquo;s right, we are capable of sexism against our fellow girls just like men are. This needs to be realized so it can be fixed. Consequently, the lunch-and-learn allowed me to discover that &ldquo;slut&rdquo; only has the definition that we choose to give it.</p>

<p>Just as Ms. Norbury (played by Tina Fey) said in <i>Mean Girls</i>, &ldquo;You all have to stop calling each other sluts. It just makes it ok for guys to call you sluts.&rdquo; High school girls, take a lesson from what you claim your favorite movie is. In fact, I hope it is your favorite movie because of this quote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In closing, my final thoughts are of the future. I wonder if there will be equality in the oddly constructed social norms of high school and higher education. I wonder if a boy will ever halt mid-sentence and reject the hurtful words he&rsquo;s about to say regarding &lsquo;that girl from last night.&rsquo; I wonder if the &lsquo;walk of shame&rsquo; can ever become the &lsquo;walk of NO shame.&rsquo; I wonder if a girl will ever be driven by her strength to grasp the feeling of dominance, and teach her boyfriend what it is to share such a quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No one should be placed in arbitrary categories by anyone else.</p>

<p>No one should be defined by anyone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A woman should never be defined by her sexual activity.</p>

<p>Mr. Schoeffel has made many contributions to our community this year, both&nbsp;large and&nbsp;small. He has introduced new traditions, and he has adjusted to many of our old ones. A new, seemingly small scale adjustment is&nbsp;the reformatting of the Weekly Update. An Upper School tradition, the Weekly Update is sent out merely to&nbsp;alert students and faculty&nbsp;of events and meetings for the coming week. This year, however, Mr. Schoeffel has added a twist. Rather than just sending out a schedule, he&nbsp;starts off each Weekly Update with words of wisdom, the past week&#39;s highlights and/or a quote of the week. While the Updates have increased in length, they have included some enlightening words that make the read worth it. Faculty&nbsp;member Geoff Nelson elaborates upon the addition, &quot;It&#39;s great, a nice change -- a dose of intellectualism and reflection amidst the banality and noise of daily school life. I appreciate that Mark has taken time to get to know our students, faculty and community at large. That he uses this knowledge with power and insight to thoughtful ends in something as potentially forgettable as the Weekly Update says volumes about his rich internal life and his obvious external empathy. He writes with a simple elegance.&quot; As the principal of the Upper School, Mr. Schoeffel represents our community-at-large.&nbsp;This easily overlooked contribution is quite symbolic of his immersion and care for the school.&nbsp;Here are some key moments that gave all of us&nbsp;the &quot;feels&quot; and illutsrate why his presence is so invaluable:</p>

<p>When Mr. Schoeffel commented on&nbsp;community events with understanding and appreciation...</p>

<p>After Fall Fair:</p>

<p><em><b id="docs-internal-guid-077c4488-5a66-8500-4a95-f97fd5031640">&quot;The support, spirit and grit, as well as the sportsmanship, all made me smile. &quot;</b></em></p>

<p>After the Honors Concert:&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><b id="docs-internal-guid-077c4488-5a67-8706-9c18-a329a17c8f27">&quot;The songs, the music, the passion and talent, and the joy were inspiring, and uplifting.&quot;</b></em></p>

<p dir="ltr">After Pericles:&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><b id="docs-internal-guid-da80a8cc-5a6e-0225-9b08-ef0495f65e39">&quot;Thank you to the cast and crew and its directors for giving the school this treat of the eyes, ears and soul, which others got to feast on over the course of the last days.&quot;</b></em></p>

<p dir="ltr">... students and faculty alike knew how much he cared and valued their extracurricular work.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_nmxi30vhEU1rt5pgzo1_500.gif"><img alt="tumblr_nmxi30vhEU1rt5pgzo1_500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4738" height="281" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_nmxi30vhEU1rt5pgzo1_500.gif" width="500" /></a></p>

<p dir="ltr">When he highlighted the things that make our community so special...</p>

<p dir="ltr">After Friday Night Lights:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><b id="docs-internal-guid-8ad96253-5a69-804f-0c88-4c0b0bb22cfe">&quot;I&rsquo;ll take liberties with Kipling and say that if you can meet triumph and loss and treat those imposters just the same, then yours is the earth and everything in it.</b>&quot;</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">After a MFW:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><b id="docs-internal-guid-8ad96253-5a6a-7f83-abd4-b7ae22b00919">&quot;...[I]n Meeting for Worship, there were new voices reaching out, honestly and bravely, speaking about such topics of importance to them. &nbsp;Our collective humanity improves with these gifts. &nbsp;We get better. &nbsp;It is a sacred trust. &nbsp;Thank you.&quot;</b></em></p>

<p dir="ltr">... he showed how he understood the school&#39;s mission on an intellectual&nbsp;level.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_n8favjTZjl1t3xmw3o1_500.gif"><img alt="tumblr_n8favjTZjl1t3xmw3o1_500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4739" height="381" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_n8favjTZjl1t3xmw3o1_500.gif" width="500" /></a></p>

<p dir="ltr">When he gave us with just the advice we needed...</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><b id="docs-internal-guid-3c1d9e50-5a6d-0ac1-b03b-c3c87c006b48">&quot;Pace yourself, and take your time. &nbsp;Someone said today, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really get anything meaningful done in five minutes.&rdquo; &nbsp;Right you are, if you are rushing, except there is a way to make five minutes meaningful: you can take that five minutes and breathe, listen, reflect, stand back, and breathe again. &nbsp;Then, five minutes is eternity!&quot;</b></em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><b id="docs-internal-guid-50295c64-5a6f-0e2d-3d28-2e951ad2d97b">&quot;Perhaps our going forward each day with a shared belief in the good in people is the best we can do to affirm that important faith in our fellow human beings, as we work to believe in love, not hatred.&quot;</b></em></p>

<p dir="ltr">... we knew that we had not only gained a new principal, but also a mentor and a friend.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_msbd2tVuRS1qf9mevo1_500.gif"><img alt="tumblr_msbd2tVuRS1qf9mevo1_500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4740" height="208" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_msbd2tVuRS1qf9mevo1_500.gif" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>When he&nbsp;shed light on this past thanksgiving break and current events...</p>

<p><em><b id="docs-internal-guid-5de39e68-5a5f-7a23-a0e2-e0c7552bc4c0">&quot;The times seem to be testing people&rsquo;s living allegiance to core democratic and humane values, and temperance, equanimity, and empathy all seem harder to grow under duress. &nbsp;I hope we will reach down, and during the break, as we gather ourselves and rest, we can reflect upon how fortunate we are to be here, to be able to learn about and from each other, and to discover what is possible in ourselves and our lives in the world. &nbsp;It is a great privilege. &nbsp;And with that bounty, there are obligations of gratitude lived, in each act and moment where our patience or even our deepest beliefs are tested or threatened. &nbsp;Like Odysseus and Penelope, we need to hold on tight, and not let go of our cherished peace and devotion to what is true. &nbsp;It is a great holiday because is not just about a family gathering, I think, but also about the human family reminding itself of what matters most.</b>​&quot;</em></p>

<p>... his words touched us and opened our mind to&nbsp;reflect on our world and humanity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_nx8vnmJb8j1ql5yr7o2_400.gif"><img alt="tumblr_nx8vnmJb8j1ql5yr7o2_400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4737" height="183" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_nx8vnmJb8j1ql5yr7o2_400.gif" width="325" /></a></p>

<p>The only questions left to ask are,</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Schoeffel, when is your book being released?&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;Where can I buy it?&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The history of the National Anthem is remarkable. Written in 1814 by an imprisoned American, Francis Scott Key, &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; is a fight song about getting through struggle or tough times. Today we utilize the tune to honor the troops who fight for our country, and the individuals who sacrificed their lives for us in the past. We use it to support the men and women who help run our nation, and to bind us closer together as Americans. The song also serves as a pregame ritual before all sporting events, from high school games to professional events. This custom is considered by some critics to be unnecessary and even demeaning to our country. Others believe it to be a great way to appreciate our nation. This lack of agreement about whether or not we should sing the National Anthem before sporting events is a hot topic in American sports.</p>

<p>The lyrics have inspired some great moments in American history. One of these moments came on September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2001. Ten days after the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers, Mark Anthony delivered one the most emotional anthems ever at Shea Stadium. He called it, &ldquo;The most nerve-racking moment of his career.&rdquo; When Anthony hit the note &ldquo;Free&rdquo; in the second to last verse the place erupted. But even if sung terribly, the fans would not have cared. At this time, the song served as more than just a collection of words or an appealing melody. It symbolized the resilience and unity of American citizens. This unity is also exemplified nightly during the hockey season in Boston. Here, Rene Rancourt has one job: to walk out onto the ice in a black suit ten minutes before game time before every game the Boston Bruins play at TD Garden and sing the National Anthem. He says he has &ldquo;the best job in the world.&rdquo; On April 17<sup>th</sup>, 2013, Rancourt had a special performance ahead of him. Less than a week earlier, there were terrorist attacks at the Boston Marathon. The city of Boston needed something to rally behind and they found it in their ice hockey team. Rancourt got through the first verse; he then cut the microphone off and let the crowd take over. With a booming, unified voice, the fans at that game finished singing our nation&rsquo;s anthem.</p>

<p>The National Anthem, like the bald eagle or the American flag, is what separates us from the hundreds of other countries across the world. It is symbolic of everything we stand for as a country. Most Americans love the feeling of patriotism and do not want to get rid of the ritual of singing the &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; before sporting events for fear that we may loose this great feeling of being unified as one country. According to Luke Cyphers&rsquo; ESPN article &ldquo;The Song Remains the Same,&rdquo; (<a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/6957582/the-history-national-anthem-sports-espn-magazine">http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/6957582/the-history-national-anthem-sports-espn-magazine</a>) most fans love singing the National Anthem. The rush of unified nationalism the event provides is something unmatched by many other moments. In a report by Andy Nesbitt from 16 WNEP news, &nbsp;he states that fans at a collegiate baseball game in Lafayette, LA were told that the National Anthem would not be played that day due to difficulties with the speakers. Then, a majority of the people including players and coaches rose and took it upon themselves to sing the anthem. &ldquo;This act shows us the deep-rooted love for singing the song fans have,&rdquo; Nesbitt says. (<a href="http://wnep.com/2015/05/19/fans-told-national-anthem-wont-be-played-but-they-sing-anyway/">http://wnep.com/2015/05/19/fans-told-national-anthem-wont-be-played-but-they-sing-anyway/</a>)</p>

<p>Supporters of the National Anthem argue that if we were to take out this tradition, we would also take out its history. Cyphers notes that the 1918 World Series at Fenway Park was the first time the anthem was sung before a game. Since then we have sung this song before almost every event. Cyphers states that eliminating the anthem from sports would be a disservice to not only our country, but also our country&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>The other side of this argument claims that the chanting of the song has become a blind action for some. Rarely does someone think about the meaning of the lyrics or what they represent. They are caught up in the fireworks, the fighter jets, or the famous artist the team brought in to sing. We also get caught up in the festivities. Yet this was not Francis Scott Key&rsquo;s purpose when he composed the song hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>Some spectators believe that singing the National Anthem is unnecessary. At a New York Jets football game this past Sunday I watched the 58,000 square foot flag be brought out to pay tribute to our country. As the anthem played I thought what could be more American? I then noticed a man roughly sixty years old get up out of his chair and stand for a few minutes trembling. He was physically too weak to stand in the hot sun. Patiently awaiting the end of the song, he stood there with his hand over his heart, when he really just came to see Brandon Marshall catch touchdown passes. At baseball games we have such a deep love for this custom that not only do we sing the National Anthem before the game, we are also asked to sing &ldquo;God Bless America&rdquo; during the seventh inning stretch. Just in case you forgot about our love for American patriotism, there&rsquo;s a reminder less than two hours away! We all love our country and whether we admit it or not, we are thankful for the freedoms it grants us. However, some think it may not be mandatory for us to sing that song every time.</p>

<p>If we carried out the tradition and rose with the eighty thousand other fans at a game, we would be confused or frustrated by a single person not doing the same thing. Say that person is not an American. He or she may not know the words. We would judge this person as someone who does not know the right thing to do strictly off this one simple action. In reality, they have the freedom to stand or not stand, sing or not sing, but this constant tradition of singing &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; does not grant them this liberty without judgment.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not a question of whether we should or shouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;rise and remove our caps for the singing of our nation&rsquo;s anthem,&rdquo; as they say at Yankee Stadium. Rather, it is more important to simply recognize the bizarre nature of anthem singing before a game or event, and the obscurity behind a crowd&rsquo;s sporadic outbursts of &ldquo;USA! USA!&rdquo; during a team&rsquo;s warm-ups. Yet reason behind it is clear. We get caught up in American nationalism. When we feel bonded to one another through our nation, we get excited or feel powerful. This unique feeling goes into overdrive at our country&rsquo;s sporting events. Fans like Samuel Lam, in his article &ldquo;Is It Necessary to Sing the National Anthem?&rdquo; believe that the mere fact that singing the song has become &ldquo;an event&rdquo; means that it has gone to far. He jokes, &ldquo;[&hellip;] But if we do that, then shouldn&rsquo;t we sing the National Anthem when we go to Wal-Mart? Only in America can we get low prices like that.&rdquo; (<a href="http://butattheendoftheday.com/2012/04/04/is-it-necessary-to-sing-the-national-anthem-before-every-sporting-event/">http://butattheendoftheday.com/2012/04/04/is-it-necessary-to-sing-the-national-anthem-before-every-sporting-event/</a>) Lam is referring to the fact that although we use the anthem to celebrate the freedom America gives us in having sporting events, there are other things our country grants us that we do not publicly appreciate.</p>

<p>As a player, I realize the effects that this tradition can have. Standing on the sidelines next to my teammates as we look up at the flag makes me remember that we are all a part of something bigger. Singing the anthem can take us out of the moment. This single tune can make us forget about plays, tackles, or goals. It reminds us about what is really important. However, at Friends Academy we are not asked to sing the National Anthem before our games. Nor do we have an American flag anywhere near our fields. When talking to faculty here I was told that this is because of the negative connotation of American nationalism and it connection to violence. I was also told that it is against Quaker values to swear to a flag. Although students have made requests to sing the &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; and to establish more flags around campus, no changes have been made.</p>

<p><br clear="ALL" />
	<br />
	As described by Anthony and Rancourt, our National Anthem has produced some of the most binding, rallying, and patriotic moments in our nation&rsquo;s history, especially in sports. However, through this tradition of singing the National Anthem before sporting events, we often loose sight of the song&rsquo;s significance. We need to balance the good this song can produce while making sure we keep its importance. We do not want to defeat the purpose of singing as one nation through pomp and circumstance or being judgmental of others who choose not to participate. The ritual is one that is deeply entrenched into our sporting events and patriotic roots as Americans. Everyone from Lou Gehrig to Michael Jordan to the random guy sitting next to you at a restaurant has sung this song countless times over. We need to monitor the usage of this great song, so that we can continue to hold onto its importance, both for those who have come before us and for those who will sing it long after we are gone.</p>

		<title>Should Schools Open Later?</title>
		<link>http://www.fa-inkwell.org/2015/11/30/should-schools-open-later/</link>

<p>Your alarm clock rings and you press the snooze button, begging for just five more minutes. Five more minutes of sleep would be excellent, but what if you could have thirty more minutes? Federal officials, doctors, and the national sleep foundation all say that schools open too early. Teens, biologically, cannot fall asleep before eleven o&#39;clock, which is why it is extremely beneficial for teen health for school to begin later. &nbsp;While teens all over the world would relish an extra thirty minutes of sleep, how will that slight delay affect everything else? Are the health benefits enough to justify the alterations in after school activities, bus schedules, and parent working hours? Some officials agree the change would have a big impact, which would produce extraordinary benefits to teen health, and that the negatives are insignificant. It is imperative to student health that we get more sleep or else our grades and safety will suffer.</p>

<p>Teens are the future, but they need sleep to get there. Research shows that most teens do not get the sleep they need on a daily basis. Teens are at an important stage of their growth and development, meaning they need all the sleep they can get&mdash;more than adults and even children. The average teen needs about nine hours of sleep at night to feel well rested and alert.</p>

<p>There are two key factors that determine how sleepy and alert you are at any time throughout the day. This relates to all children, as well as teens and adults. The first factor is how long it has been since you last slept, also known as the sleep-wake balance. The longer you withstand sleep, the more you risk throwing off your sleep-wake balance. This will cause the familiar feeling of being &ldquo;sleepy.&rdquo; The second factor is your internal body clock. This controls your body&rsquo;s 24 hour cycle, formally known as its &quot;circadian rhythm.&quot; This is the thing that tells you when you&#39;re tired and when you are awake, when you should sleep and when you should work. It is a natural timing system that everyone has. Everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;clock&rdquo; should cause feelings of sleepiness sometime in the afternoon and feelings of exhaustion at night. However, a deficit in quality sleep can make you feel drowsy at the wrong times of day. &nbsp;Teens can throw off their body clocks by staying up late at night. Their clocks will also be off if they are always changing when they sleep and wake up. When their internal clocks are not set right, teens can become very sleepy when they should be wide awake. This can cause them to fall asleep at school, at work, or while they are driving. By staying up late completing homework, and waking up early, we risk not only harming ourselves but others. We must listen to the chemicals in our body that tell us we are tired and need rest.</p>

<p>While many adults are quick to blame teens for their bad sleeping habits, it is biologically out of our control. When puberty hits, along with body changes, your circadian rhythms change. This means that melatonin&mdash;a hormone that makes you feel tired&mdash;isn&#39;t released until eleven to twelve o&#39;clock at night. This is in contrast to melatonin levels for younger and older individuals, which begin to affect the body around eight to nine o&#39;clock at night. Teens physically do not feel tired until later, making early morning sleep pivotal for teen development.</p>

<p>Officials say kids need more sleep for better, healthier, and safer academic performance. A new federal report says that high schools start their days too early, not letting teens get the sleep their bodies require for academic success and development. The report, published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows that fewer than one in five middle and high schools in the U.S. start at the recommended 8:30 a.m. start time or later. That start time was recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, based on research that proved young people need more time to sleep in for their health. The data came from a survey, taken in 2012, of 40,000 middle, high, and combined public schools. The report showed that in 42 states, 75% to 100% of public schools start before 8:30 a.m. The average school start time is 8:03 a.m. Louisiana has the earliest start time of 7:40 a.m., and Alaska has the latest start time of 8:33 a.m. Starting school times later allows teens to get the optimal amount of sleep, which is anywhere between eight and a half to nine and a half hours. Data shows that two out of three high school students sleep less than eight hours a night. Medical experts say that a lack of sleep can lead to health issues like weight gain, lower academic performance, and a greater likelihood for substance abuse.</p>

<p>Medical experts and the current U.S. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, support changes in school start times. Duncan told TIME magazine, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s completely a local decision, but I&rsquo;d like to see more school districts at least consider delaying start times. A later start to the school day could help boost students&rsquo; academic performance and reduce tardiness and absenteeism. Our common sense tells us that sleepy students don&rsquo;t do well in school, but the research also exists to back it up. Studies show that when students are rested, they are more alert and ready to learn.&rdquo; Delaying school start times could be a difficult task for many schools and the move often causes parents to begin worrying about how it will affect after-school activities.</p>

<p>At Friends Academy, students come from all over. Some live less than 10 minutes away and some, with traffic, could take up to an hour to get to school. That is why our school start time is hard to understand. Some people begin their day as early as five o&rsquo;clock in the morning. So the school start time of 8:05 is a hard task for many. When I asked multiple students if a half hour delay to the school time would positively impact their routines, they all said yes without hesitation. Some said even five minutes would make a difference. According to Sasha Levin&rsquo;s article on the direct relationship between sleep and grades, limited amounts of sleep result in a poor school performance. What&rsquo;s the point for teens to sit in a classroom at eight thirty in the morning if they will retain nothing?</p>

<p>Schools in 44 states have already altered their school start times in order to help teens receive the sleep they need for healthy growth and development. In Alabama, Phenix City schools send the early grades to school 45 minutes earlier, moving them from 9:00 to 7:45,&nbsp;and middle and high school students an hour and 15 minutes later, moving them from 7:45 to 9:00. Superintendent Wilkes says the later start time for older students is an effort to increase student success. The school, since the change, has seen a strong increase in student performance. &nbsp;Campbell Hall in California took a different approach to combat the issue. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays grades 7-12 of the K-12 school start at 8:50 a.m. On Wednesdays, grades 7-12 start at 9:30 a.m. Classes and lunchtime were slightly shortened. Students now get out at 3:40 p.m. instead of 3:15 p.m. These are all slight changes that are having a large impact on all of the students. Teachers are reporting that their students are more motivated and attentive. Parents and teachers have also seen a decrease of anxiety and stress levels in most students.</p>

<p>Changing school times is tough, but the impact it makes on student health is astonishing. If dozens of schools have made the switch to later start times why can&#39;t we? The delay could make students who have, in the past, struggled with school flourish. A discussion should be had to, at least, weigh the pros and cons. No idea is perfect, but this might just work for many tired teens.</p>

		<title>Should the 2015 NFL Draft Have Gone the Way It Did?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[embed]https://flic.kr/p/aEqSaQ[/embed]</p>

<p>The 2015 NFL draft class looked like a promising one, with several versatile collegiate athletes such as Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota, Leonard Williams, Dante Fowler Jr., Vic Beasley, Danny Shelton, Shane Ray, Amari Cooper, Brandon Scherff, Ereck Flowers, Kevin White, and Todd Gurley. The big question of this draft concerned which player would go number one overall to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were in desperate need of a quarterback. Would it be Jameis Winston, out of Florida State, or Marcus Mariota, out of Oregon? Winston ended up going number one to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Mariota went second overall to the Tennessee Titans, but after seeing both players perform in the first four weeks of their NFL career, critics were left with the question: did the Tampa Bay Buccaneers make the right decision?</p>

<p>Winston was a two-year starter at Florida State. He won twenty-six of the twenty-seven games he started in. He was the Heisman Trophy winner in 2013. He was therefore a very popular draft choice, because of his college background. He is coming from a program where he was predominantly used as a pocket passer, which would help him carry over to a more pro style offense in the NFL. Although Winston did have some trouble off the field and some weaknesses at his draft showcase, he was still a popular choice for the number one overall pick because he knew how to run the pro style offense coaches and scouts were looking for.</p>

<p>Mariota was a freshman redshirt, meaning he was on the team but did not play, and transitioned into a two-year starter at Oregon. He won the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, Davey O&#39;Brien (National QB Award) and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award in 2014. He was also selected as Walter Camp Player of the Year, Associated Press Player of the Year, Walter Camp first-team All-America and Associated Press first-team All-American. He was also selected as Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and 2015 Rose Bowl Offensive MVP. Marcus Mariota looks very good and dominant on paper, but he is coming from a top program in the Pac 12 conference, and Oregon dominated the conference. Scouts and coaches love the way he performs, his attributes, mechanics, and form, and the way he moves and throws the ball. They also love how he knows so much about the game, and his awareness on the field.</p>

<p>During the NFL off-season, scouts and coaches congregate and discuss what is absolutely necessary for the franchise to be successful. For example, last year the New York Giants drafted Odell Beckham Jr., a wide receiver out of Louisiana State University (LSU). Beckham, also known as OBJ, was not a necessary pick for the Giants, but the Giants took a chance with him hoping that it would pay off from what they saw on season highlights. OBJ went on to win rookie of the year last season and has become a huge asset to Eli Manning and the entire Giants franchise. This past season the Giants drafted an offensive lineman, Ereck Flowers, out of the University of Miami. This pick was a necessary one for the Giants because last season the offensive line struggled with personnel and injuries. This is not specific to the Giants franchise only. For example, last year the Jacksonville Jaguars drafted Blake Bortles out of University of Central Florida (UCF), a pick that was one hundred percent necessary, as the Jaguars desperately needed a quarterback. This past season the Jaguars did the same thing: they took a great draft pick for what they desperately needed&mdash;running back T.J. Yeldon, out of the University of Alabama. The Jacksonville Jaguars are on track to rebuild their franchise using young athletic players. With the past pick of Jameis Winston, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are on track to rebuild as well.</p>

<p>Before the NFL season kicks off there are four preseason games so rookies and other players get a few games under their belt before diving head first into the fast pace, hard hitting, and intensive NFL season. Preseason games mean nothing to the veterans or established starters, but to rookies and undrafted players this is the chance of a lifetime. These games mean everything to them. They can dictate whether or not they will have a career for the next six months. Mariota preformed better than Winston, completing more of his passes, and throwing two touchdowns and one interception. Winston, on the other hand, threw 23 for 47 (one hundred yards less than Mariota), no touchdowns, and two inceptions.</p>

<p>As fate would have it, during week 1 of their professional career the two rookies would face each other. Going into the game people said that Winston was the favorite because he went number one overall and had two threatening receivers, Vincent Jackson and Mike Evans; he could also throw the long ball. The Titans also had weapons: wide receiver Kendall Wright and tight end Delanie Walker. Stacked up, these teams didn&rsquo;t seem very different. Both had rookie Heisman winning quarterbacks and a solid receiving core, but what separated them were the unsung heroes of football: the offensive line, which can make or break a team. Those players play every play of every drive on offense; they bang heads and play in and play out to protect their star players. The difference between the offensive lines in this situation was that the Tampa Bays&rsquo; line had played together for a while, while Tennessee had a few rookies on the line who were trying out different positions to see what would work best. After week one Mariota came out on top with a crushing victory of 42-14. After week one the question then became, was Winston the correct number one overall draft pick?</p>

<p>Now that three more weeks have passed, critics are left to wonder whether Jameis Winston should have gone number one overall? Or should that position have gone to Marcus Mariota, the former quarter back of the Oregon Ducks? Although Mariota is coming from a totally different offensive play style, he has proven himself to be able to learn and adapt to his new offense. He and the Titans stand at a record of 1 win and 2 losses. Winston, on the other hand, has proven himself as well. Although this past week Winston struggled with throwing the ball, going 26 for 43, he also had 287 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, and 4 interceptions. His team came up short against the 4 and 0 Carolina Panthers with a loss of 23-37.</p>

		<title>Should Athletes Be Role Models?</title>

<p>&ldquo;I&#39;m not a role model... Just because I dunk a basketball doesn&#39;t mean I should raise your kids.&rdquo; &nbsp;In the 1993, Charles Barkley issued this controversial statement, which began a debate that remains relevant today. As a kid, I always looked up to Derek Jeter and other top sports stars of teams I liked (although admittedly there were never any true superstars in the New York Franchises besides Jeter). Nevertheless, I, along with most of the students at this school, either used to look up to or still do look up to many famous athletes of the past and present, ranging from Michael Jordan to Roger Federer. We all love to revere sports stars as heroic figures. It&rsquo;s what we do as fans. But Charles Barkley&rsquo;s statement raises a few really good questions. First of all, why do we look at athletes in such a heroic light? Second, what should a real role model be like? Should athletes be considered role models?</p>

<p>Even though the debate really picked up when Barkley spoke his mind, the struggle over who we expect athletes to be as people has been going on for a long time. As a society, we tend to adore athletes we like to the point where they can get away with almost anything. The biggest area of concern is what athletes do away from the ball field. In a society where we tell athletes that the public will love them even if they behave inappropriately, you cannot blame them for some of their mishaps. So let us look at examples of what some of our beloved athletes have done that will sort of make you cringe. Ty Cobb, MLB Hall of Famer, once beat up a fan in the year 1912, and the press excused him, blaming the fan for using profound language; one cannot help thinking that this was because Ty Cobb was the most popular baseball player at the time. Dating back all the way to 1887, famous baseball player, Mike &ldquo;King&rdquo; Kelly, was an alcoholic. The fans did not care about that: they still cheered him on passionately and revered him as a role model. Not to say you cannot love somebody who is an alcoholic, but they may not be the best role model for children. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In our time period, however, things have changed. As a society, we tend to look very closely at every move athletes make off the field due to the 24-hour media cycle that exists. This is why many top athletes have been considered role models, until the fans can no longer love them, due to off the field issues. We have seen many top sports icons fall into a scandal and damage their reputation to the point where they are no longer someone who parents want their children looking up to. Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, and Hulk Hogan all come to mind as stars that we cannot really look at in the same light due to the way their scandals have been either accurately or inaccurately (often up for debate) portrayed in the news. But sometimes in this argument, it is easy to lose sight of why so many people do not want to consider athletes as role models.</p>

<p>Can athletes be irresponsible? Yes. Do athletes sometimes take on the personas of Hollywood stars rather than ball players? Absolutely. Can athletes do anything to prevent their public image from getting ruined by the media due to personal, off-the-field mishaps? Absolutely not. But at the end of the day, if we started hating every athlete who is kind of a jerk behind closed doors, there probably won&rsquo;t be any heroes left, besides maybe Roger Federer. Nobody seems to be able to hate Roger Federer. Nevertheless, it is not so much about examining what athletes should do; instead, it is about what role models should do.</p>

<p>In order to be role model, one must demonstrate a certain set of values. These values include traits and characteristics such as confidence, leadership, communicating well, and showing respect for others. Many athletes are actually able to demonstrate these qualities, but that is not why they are beloved by every sports crowd. They are cheered for their athletic ability. Children need role models who they can praise for their ability to guide them and teach them. Just because someone can dunk balls or hit home runs doesn&rsquo;t mean they should be the person that children look up to. Quite simply, the people that are the true role models in our society&mdash;the people children should really be looking at&mdash;are their parents and teachers. Charles Barkley was spot on when he said that he shouldn&rsquo;t be raising anybody&rsquo;s kids. Teachers and parents are the people who are supposed to turn kids into young adults and teach lessons that they will use for a lifetime. Not some professional basketball player. This becomes sort of difficult; from personal experience, I will say that it is way more fun and a whole lot cooler to look up to the athletes than to look up to your teachers. These people actually teach kids everything, and though they are models they aren&rsquo;t recognized as such.</p>

<p>As a kid, you want to be your favorite athlete. It is somewhat inexplicable, but you just want to be them. A study performed by researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation, showed that athletes are the most admired people by children, with 73% of the children saying that they looked up to athletes the most &ndash; second only to their parents. 9 out of 10 kids proclaimed that professional athletes have a positive influence on them. Three-fourths of the 1,500 10-17 year olds said that athletes taught them that showing character and sportsmanship are more important than winning. They also say that athletes showed them that success demands hard work and dedication. However, all of these positives are not the only thing that kids take away from following their favorite athletes. In this same survey, 1 in every 5 kids said that by following athletes, they shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about consequences for acting inappropriately. Other children said that it is okay to use alcohol and drugs because athletes do it all the time and often get away with it. 74% of the kids surveyed saw it commonplace for athletes to yell at officials, 62% said it was ordinary for players to disrespect and taunt opposing players, 52% said it was normal for players to use illegal or banned substances to improve performance, and 46% said they frequently see athletes take cheap shots against other players on the other teams. Sure, 87% of the kids surveyed said it was not okay to take a cheap shot against an opponent, but if children start seeing athletes continuously taking the cheap shots or taunting the opponent, sooner or later they will start to mirror those same actions. 56% of the kids surveyed said that it is typical to see younger athletes yelling at officials. A percentage of kids taunting and cheap shots are just as common in professional sports as they are in sports between young athletes. If you want to check out the actual survey, the link is here:&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2000/09/3070-sof-national-survey-of-kids-and-their-parents-about-famous-athletes-as-role-models.pdf">https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2000/09/3070-sof-national-survey-of-kids-and-their-parents-about-famous-athletes-as-role-models.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>So once the issues with having athletes as role models are established, and once we realize our true models in society, one component of this argument becomes clear. It&rsquo;s become abundantly clear, for all the reasons that have been discussed, that the answer to the question &ldquo;Should athletes be role models&rdquo; is &ldquo;No, of course not; they&rsquo;re athletes.&rdquo; However, there&rsquo;s a part inside all of us that says: &ldquo;Yes, of course they should be; they&rsquo;re athletes.&rdquo; At the end of the day there are hundreds of reasons why athletes shouldn&rsquo;t be the people that children base themselves on, yet there is only one reason why children do look up to athletes: They can&rsquo;t help it.</p>

<p>Although at times, we may know too much about athletes and their moral obligations, most of their misconduct, both on and off the field, vanishes once we see them become heroes during a game. The magic of sports is that no matter what happens off the field, there&rsquo;s a certain type of emotion evoked during the actual game that cannot be ignored. The intensity of professional sports as well as whether or not an athlete can perform under big these intense moments are often enough to make us forget everything else that went on behind the scenes. For example, Kobe Bryant, one of the most intense, gritty, and most importantly successful athletes of all time was involved in a sexual assault case in 2003. Although we may look back at his career with a few very big red flags, what we will remember most about Kobe Bryant will be his 5 championship rings, his historic 81-point game, and all the amazing moments he had in the playoffs. Retired middle linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, Ray Lewis, was involved in a murder trial, and it is still in question today as to whether or not he committed the murder. Again, when people say the name Ray Lewis, although they may cringe remembering his murder trial, people will remember him as a fierce football player and great team leader.</p>

<p>So because people are going to revere athletes regardless of how they behave, do the athletes have a moral obligation to demonstrate appropriate behavior? In an ideal world: no. Nobody should HAVE to act as a role model unless they are a parent or teacher; in fact, I&rsquo;ve established that athletes really aren&rsquo;t great role models. The responsibility of athletes is to do their jobs and be productive playing their sports. However, the emphasis on sports in the media today allows everyone to see every move these athletes make. Ideally, setting a good example for everyone should not be the responsibility of an athlete. They shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have to focus on setting good examples, yet they are completely aware that everything they do is being followed thousands and thousands of fans. With that in mind, it could very well be argued that athletes should be cognizant of everyone watching them, both on and off the field. At the same time, however, athletes are paid to play, and we, as fans, have made them our role models. So could this really be our responsibility that we have put on them, or is it their job as professionals to set a good example for society? It goes both ways, but the bottom line is, whether or not it is right to expect athletes to act a certain way, they are still going to be evaluated regarding everything they do.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[embed]https://flic.kr/p/98PULS[/embed]</p>

<p>When I first came to Friends Academy during my sophomore year, I was completely shocked by the lack of online grading systems. As a student in a public school district that used such systems, I had come to view online grading systems as a fundamental right of all students everywhere&mdash;a tool that everyone could and should be able to access. But what shocked me even more than the lack of such systems was the fact that students were not, as I would have thought, begging for such systems to be put into effect<em>. </em>At first, I tried to adopt the no online grade access policy into my beliefs, in order to better understand this point of view. However, after a year of following this system, I have realized that the potential for online grade books to help students is too great to be ignored. At Friends, online grade books are not at the forefront of many students&rsquo; minds, perhaps because the existence and benefits of such systems are relatively unknown to the student body. Once such a system is in place, however, it will be impossible to imagine life without it. Online grade books allow students the opportunity to manage their grades with more ease, thought, and understanding than the current system. As a result, responsibility on behalf of the students will also increase, an added benefit for teachers. Thus, teachers should be required to implement online grading systems for student access in order to facilitate students&rsquo; ease with the grading process.</p>

<p>Online grading, at the very least, clears up the exact breakdown of how students&rsquo; grades are calculated. In the current system, although teachers do hand out their grading policies on the first day of classes, there is an overall lack of clarity as to which areas students need to further improve upon, as students cannot easily view their scores in different areas of assessments, let alone calculate weighted percentages. Students in the current grading system are forced to talk with their teachers to find out their current grades. But although teachers may know a student&rsquo;s overall grade, most cannot offhandedly provide a complete analysis of each area. For example, I have often found when I ask teachers about my grades that many are only able to tell me whether I have an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; or &ldquo;B&rdquo; grade or that they have &ldquo;noticed a drop in homework grades&rdquo; or &ldquo;noticed an increase in test grades.&rdquo; But they are never able to describe the exact percentages in various areas. In online grade systems, students can easily view the weightages of different areas of assessment&mdash;tests, homework assignments, and participation scores&mdash;and understand how their respective scores in each type of assessment affect their overall grade. Ultimately, this enables students to understand exactly which aspects of their performance need improvement.</p>

<p>Such grading systems also hold teachers accountable for their work. Teachers, contrary to what we may believe, are in fact human and prone to making the occasional error while entering grades. With grade book accessibility for students, the number of teacher-related errors will be diminished, as students will have the opportunity to double check whether grades have been inputted correctly. Additionally, final grades will no longer be as subject to teachers&rsquo; whims, since the mathematical breakdown of grades will be displayed online and will not leave much room for the &ldquo;fudging&rdquo; of numbers. Students will no longer be able to make claims like &ldquo;so-and-so teacher doesn&rsquo;t like me and that&rsquo;s why I have bad grades&rdquo; or other, similar remarks.</p>

<p>Mark Alber, Honors Chemistry and AP Chemistry teacher, is one of a handful of FA instructors that have already implemented online gradebook systems in their classrooms for transparency purposes. He notes,&ldquo;I came to FA from a school that had a school wide system where students and parents could easily access grades, assignments, and attendance, and I thought it worked very well. It&rsquo;s natural that students want to know how they&rsquo;re doing. An online grade book lets students see if they&rsquo;re missing any assignments or if there are any mistakes with their grades. My goal is to make grading and grades as transparent and accurate as possible. I don&rsquo;t want students to feel like the grades they receive in chemistry are arbitrary.&rdquo; Overall, online grading systems will increase teacher accountability and accuracy.</p>

<p>While students are supposed to ask their teachers for their grades whenever they would like, realistically, this is not a feasible option. In addition to not wanting to nag and annoy their teachers with incessant requests, most students simply do not have the time to physically check their grades often. Checking grades through the current system requires students to either coordinate times with their teachers or hope that they are in their rooms during students&rsquo; frees&mdash;all to find out one grade. To find out all of one&rsquo;s grades in the current system requires the process to be repeated anywhere from five to nine times, depending on how many courses the student is enrolled in. Grades, which are solely a quantitative measurement, should not be this difficult to acquire.</p>

<p>Despite the various advantages online grade books would provide teachers at FA, some instructors have asserted that their biggest concern about implementing the systems is that they will hinder student-teacher communication. Supposedly, online grade book access will reduce the number of students initiating one-on-one conversations. However, the only aspect of grades that such grade books convey is the breakdown of grades themselves. The most vital parts of student-teacher conversations, which involve teacher feedback, student input, discussion of personal goals, how to improve on assignments, why a certain score was received, or other qualitative observations, must still occur through a face-to-face student-teacher conversation, as online grade books do not have the capability to convey such information. With the introduction of online grade books, student-teacher conversations will actually improve in quality, as students can prepare analytical, quantitative information about their grades before conversations and focus the discussion more on qualitative aspects of performance that grade books do not convey. As student Jacob Hutt articulated, &ldquo;Grade books create more dialogue between the teacher and student as the student has more information to discuss with the teacher.&rdquo; Friends Academy values student-teacher conversations as a benefit of being a small school, but our emphasis is on having qualitative conversations directed towards improvement, not quantitative, grade-centered conversations.</p>

<p>The administration&rsquo;s other major apprehension regarding online grade books is that they would play into the longstanding culture of achievement within the school: allegedly, online grade books would make everything about obtaining high end-results, which further increases student stress levels. Although a low-stress environment is something our school should strive towards, declaring that online grade books would increase student stress should not be an automatic assumption. For one, the anxiety of not always knowing grades and report card surprises can produce more stress for students than if they had known their grade all along and could have taken the necessary steps for improvement in time (http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/05/05/tracking-students-grades-minute-by-minute-help-or-hindrance/). &nbsp;As junior Brooke Juhel put it, &ldquo;Online grade books are helpful because they give the student access to their grades at all times, which takes away from the anxiety of not knowing&hellip; If I don&rsquo;t have an idea of how I am doing in a class, I won&rsquo;t know if I need to improve on something or change study strategies.&rdquo; In some cases, students might actually feel unnecessary stress thinking they are doing worse than they actually are. &ldquo;I feel more stress not knowing my grades because I might have one bad assessment in mind that I think is bringing me down a lot more than it is,&rdquo; said Juhel.</p>

<p>Additionally, students can experience more stress from receiving disappointing grades in front of their peers, particularly if they have a physical and emotional reaction to bad grades. One student at FA, who chose to remain anonymous, said that they dreaded having to receive such grades in front of peers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A couple of times last year, I got tests back from my teacher that I did unexpectedly worse on than I thought I had. I blushed a lot when I got them, and so everyone could immediately tell that I didn&rsquo;t do well. The embarrassment of everyone knowing my grades, which I try to keep private, added to my stress&hellip; It might be helpful if we could get our grades online through grade books so people wouldn&rsquo;t see my initial reactions to my grades,&rdquo; said the student.</p>

<p>AP Chemistry teacher Alber&rsquo;s student of two years Jason Wang expressed a similar sentiment as to the effect of online grade books among peers: &ldquo;Other people don&rsquo;t see your grades as much with the use of [online grade books] and this might reduce the culture of everyone trying see each other&rsquo;s grades within the school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second aspect of the argument against grade books, that they increase the culture of achievement by emphasizing the &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; rather than the learning process, also appears to be a moot point. In Juhel&rsquo;s opinion, &ldquo;[Gradebooks] would not play into the &lsquo;culture of achievement&rsquo; because students already care about their grades. It is just easier to have [grades] online than it is to find a time when teachers are free to ask them what their grade is,&rdquo; said Juhel. Students in the current system are already grade-minded in their approach to their coursework. Thus having online grade books only makes the process more convenient for students and teachers- gradebooks would not affect it for the worse.</p>

<p>Mark Alber also observed that the grade books do not appear to change his students&rsquo; fixation with grades within his chemistry classes. &ldquo;I think most students use the online grade book in a reasonable fashion. Some students are obsessed with grades, but I don&rsquo;t think having the grade book online changes that one way or another.&rdquo; His student Jason Wang noted this and spoke in regards to his physics and chemistry classes: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think grade books would affect anything&hellip; Buechler and Alber have been using grade books and students have been fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Essentially, FA students in Alber and other teachers&rsquo; classes have already demonstrated a healthy precedent for the potential use of school-wide grade books by indicating the ability for the student body to utilize such a resource in a very responsible fashion. Yes, there may be students that are more grade-oriented than most others, but online grade books will not affect this outcome&mdash;rather, they will improve the lives of the majority of the students who do handle such resources responsibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think online grade books will actually help temper [the culture of achievement] because students can see how exactly a specific assignment affects their overall grade&hellip; They ultimately don&rsquo;t become obsessed with specific tests they feel are bringing their grade down and will take a more holistic approach to improving their grades and overall academic experience,&rdquo; said FA junior Jacob Hutt.</p>

<p>Upperclassman Freyja Goldstein likewise upheld her belief in the ability for online grade books to reduce the culture of achievement, but for an entirely different reason. &ldquo;I think that [sites like] mygradebook.com actually work to alleviate the culture of achievement because you [as a student] always know where you are. You are motivated to get yourself to where you want to be, but you&rsquo;re also able to be realistic with your goals. And the student can have all this without having to nag the teacher about it,&rdquo; Goldstein remarked. Students will no longer be tempted to pull &ldquo;Hail Marys&rdquo; or make other extravagant requests to their teachers for the sole purpose of obtaining good final grades because such systems take away student excuses for their work (KQED).</p>

<p>One significant distinction that should be considered when examining the potential use of online grade book systems at Friends Academy is the restriction of parent access to children&rsquo;s grades. Although at many schools online grade book access is also available to parents, grade books that only allow access to students are available, such as through websites like mygradebook.com. This distinction is vital to making sure student stress is not escalated by the use of grade books. Parent access to grades would create a breed of &ldquo;helicopter parents,&rdquo; or those parents who constantly hover over their children&rsquo;s grades, and result in more pressure on students and a restriction of their children&rsquo;s independence. (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/24/education-online-grades-helicopter-parents/2862105/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/24/education-online-grades-helicopter-parents/2862105/</a>). The goal of grade books is to help the <em>student</em> thrive in their coursework by increasing the responsibility and active participation he or she can take- not for parents to assert complete control and micromanage their children&rsquo;s grades. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/LIVING/05/31/digital.helicopter.parent/index.html?hpt=us_t3">http://www.cnn.com/2011/LIVING/05/31/digital.helicopter.parent/index.html?hpt=us_t3</a>)</p>

<p>Online grade books at Friends Academy should begin gaining further focus amongst students and teachers alike. Their ability to aid student development of independence, responsibility, and reflection regarding their work, all of which are essential to character growth, is not to be ignored. Thus, all teachers should be required to use online grading systems across FA.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like a dark storm cloud that hangs above your head constantly, it&rsquo;s always looming in your mind.&nbsp; It may not start to feel real until you&rsquo;re too far in.&nbsp; To many, it&rsquo;s considered a nightmare that will literally keep you up at night.&nbsp; Anxiety, pressure, and suspense overwhelm you.&nbsp; You lose sight of what is important and what actually matters.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;m talking about might seem like a scary dream, or a horror film, but in reality it is so much worse.&nbsp; The college process.&nbsp; The mere sound of it makes us cringe.&nbsp; Its presence is always there, reminding us to be better and do better, but when does it really hit?&nbsp; Senior year, first semester.</p>

<p>No one will warn you about the stress of the process&mdash;the endless applications, meetings with college counselors, re-writing supplements until they&rsquo;re &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, etc.&nbsp; No one will tell you that your first semester of senior year will be harder and more trying than all of your years of high school. &nbsp;It does not need to be like this, though. &nbsp;The process should be exciting and inviting to students&mdash;an opportunity to experience life as an independent adult&mdash;but our society has made the word &ldquo;college&rdquo; alone sound more terrifying than anything we could have ever imagined. &nbsp;So how much of this process can we actually control? Is it even worth the worry?</p>

<p>As someone who has taken the dreaded ACT test a total of 5 times, I understand how trying this process can be.&nbsp; There are now officially 850 test optional colleges that do not even require these test scores, so why even bother taking it? &nbsp;One reason might be that the schools that do not require these tests are &nbsp;not for everybody.&nbsp; When scrolling through the list, it is not hard to recognize that many of these schools are small, liberal arts colleges. This does not help people like me, for example, since I am looking for a different type of institution: a big, state school.&nbsp; Although the option is there, it is not available for students looking for something different. ( full list here <a href="http://www.fairtest.org/university/optional">http://www.fairtest.org/university/optional</a> )</p>

<p>The SAT was introduced in 1926 as an optional test, so that students might be considered for scholarships or financial aid.&nbsp; As time went on, the number of students taking these tests increased, and now you can&rsquo;t find someone in the Friends community who hasn&rsquo;t made plans to take the test, or taken it already. Though most students take this test, many schools believe that they are irrelevant, and that GPA matters more.&nbsp; The concept of the standardized test is fair in theory, but in practice there seem to be many disadvantages.&nbsp; To register for an ACT, including the &ldquo;optional&rdquo; writing section, a student must pay $43.&nbsp; Now take that number and think about the many students who take this test more than once.&nbsp; For example, I took the test five times.&nbsp; This comes out to be $215, plus the price of the TI-84 calculator ($190) which is recommended for the test.&nbsp; Add&nbsp; to this the cost of the <em>Real ACT Test Prep</em> recommended by the ACT($30) and finally the price of a tutor, ($400 a week for on average one year, which comes to about $20,800 per year)&nbsp; In total, this test would cost $21,235 for a person who gets tutored for one year, and takes the test five times.&nbsp; This points out one of the many reasons why this test is biased.&nbsp; What about the families that cannot spend this type of money on this test? Studies have shown that minority families seem to be taking advantage of test optinal schools more than others.&nbsp; &nbsp;A report done by Lynn O&rsquo;Shaughessy on CBS news states: &ldquo;A&nbsp;new study&nbsp;suggests that even though one of the main motivations that these colleges cite in adopting a test-optional policy is creating more diverse campuses by improving the admission chances of low-income and minority students, they&#39;re falling short of that target.&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/whos-benefiting-from-test-optional-colleges/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/whos-benefiting-from-test-optional-colleges/</a>) Even though the option is available, it is clear that students from low-income families are more inclined to take them rather than students who can afford the testing process.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below is a graph that shows the advantage that students who are wealthier have.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-30-at-9.56.55-PM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-30 at 9.56.55 PM" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4766" height="237" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-30-at-9.56.55-PM.png" width="395" /></a></p>

<p>(<a href="http://theunsilencedscience.blogspot.com/">http://theunsilencedscience.blogspot.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Students are striving for &ldquo;good&rdquo; test scores, so they can get into the college of their choice.&nbsp; In our community, the average test score of a high school senior in America would be considered low, or not good enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-30-at-9.58.08-PM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-30 at 9.58.08 PM" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4767" height="271" src="http://www.fa-inkwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-30-at-9.58.08-PM.png" width="646" /></a></p>

<p>When asking around, more than 30 students in the class of 2016 said they would not be satisfied with a composite score of 20-22.&nbsp; The average score of a student taking this test, is anywhere from a 20-21, so why is our community so convinced that this is just not good enough? Is it becoming harder to get into schools that were once considered easy? Why are students so focused on reaching the goal of a 30 or even 35? The environment we live in, Friends and Long Island in general, has created this frenzy about being the best, and not settling for anything less.&nbsp; This pressure is causing seniors all over to crack. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the north shore of Long Island, specifically, this process has become the topic of most if not all conversations.&nbsp; Because of the culture, many students have felt that when applying to schools they need to apply to only the best, and that can only be done with a high ACT score, preferably in the range of 29-34.&nbsp; When asking around the FA community, the majority of seniors (that were asked) agreed that because of some scores on tests, they will not apply to some of the schools they once dreamed of attending.&nbsp; Many think that it is not worth applying if they know a rejection letter is in their future.&nbsp; The pressure of doing well on this test not only affects what college kids are going to apply to but also how students will do on the actual exam. Personally, I know that the pressure I have put on myself to reach this &ldquo;goal&rdquo; number has weakened my ability to actually achieve it.&nbsp; Many students know are applying to &ldquo;safety&rdquo; schools or schools they know they can get into with the score they have.&nbsp; Yes, these schools do take some of the pressure off, but why even get excited about getting into a school you know you wont go to?</p>

<p>(<a href="http://collegeapps.about.com/od/GPA-SAT-ACT-Graphs/ss/Wright-State-University-GPA-SAT-and-ACT-Data.htm">http://collegeapps.about.com/od/GPA-SAT-ACT-Graphs/ss/Wright-State-University-GPA-SAT-and-ACT-Data.htm</a>)</p>

<p>Above we see the spread of admissions based on ACT/SAT scores from Wright State University.&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission to this university is guaranteed for students who have finished the core curriculum given at their school and have a GPA of 2.0 or higher.&nbsp; The ACT score necessary to get in is a 15 composite.&nbsp; Here we see a school that has let many people in, but note by the number of blue dots that many won&rsquo;t attend.&nbsp; This is the problem with our &ldquo;safe&rdquo; schools.&nbsp; We know we would get in, but never end up applying.&nbsp; We as a culture want to go to the best schools, not the safety schools.&nbsp; Success is the endgame, but why is it only achievable at some places?&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t you have success at your &ldquo;safe&rdquo; school?&nbsp; The answer is that you can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming from a school like this, we have been gifted with tools that will lead us to success no matter where we go.&nbsp; Going through this process has taught me that I am so much more than just a number on a standardized test.&nbsp; Although it may seem hard to believe, college admissions counselors know this too.&nbsp; Any school you choose to attend will be lucky to have you, and you will do great things there.&nbsp; Remember that in 10 years from now, you won&rsquo;t remember the number you got on the SAT or ACT or what colleges rejected you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll remember how much fun you had with your friends, important lessons you learned, and what you learned about yourself.&nbsp; Although it may feel like the end of the world, this process is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the U.N. hosting climate talks in Paris just last week, there has been been heated debate over whether or not world leaders should be so focused on the issue of global warming, with many other problems, such as the current Syrian refugee crisis and ISIS, appearing to be far more pressing. Many politicians have espoused such a view- most recently, Donald Trump, who questioned why Barack Obama is focusing on the environment when the threat of ISIS is growing each day. People like Donald Trump who make statements like this fail to understand what many security analysts, scientists, and government officials have known for decades: Global warming is undoubtably a factor in the rise of terrorism, and the connection between the two problems that our world is facing today means that we cannot possibly solve the resultant problem (terrorism) if we ignore the first (global warming).</p>

<p>When Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders used the terrorist attacks in Paris to call for action to address climate change, he attracted ridicule across the political spectrum. However, while many were quick to attack him for his statement, &ldquo;many academics and national security experts agree that climate change contributes to an uncertain world where terrorism can thrive.&rdquo; US military officials refer to this concept as a &ldquo;threat multiplier&rdquo;; climate change takes &ldquo;issues like terrorism that already pose a threat to national security and exacerbates the damage they can cause.&rdquo; (Worland) A 2014 Department of Defense Report further elaborates on how the damage from climate change can lead to global instability, the major factor in terrorism. Their report states that, &ldquo;rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels and extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict. They will likely lead to food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and destruction by natural disasters in regions across the globe.&rdquo; (DoD) With an increase in instability comes an increased risk for terrorism; So, because so much of global instability can be traced back to climate change, why are so many individuals failing to make the connection between global warming and terrorism?</p>

<p>No one has the answer to that. But, when you read and listen to people who actually understand the issues (like Bill Nye, who explains the link between global warming and terrorism very succinctly: ), it becomes apparent the real-world impact that global warming is having on our fight against terrorism right now. Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples.</p>

<p>The first country I&rsquo;m going to pinpoint is Nigeria. The country is threatened by both a devastating drought&nbsp; and violence from the terrorist group Boko Haram. At first glance, it doesn&rsquo;t seem credible that these two events are related. Yet, they are deeply intertwined, with Nigeria&rsquo;s worsening social and political situation being directly influenced by the state of the environment. The population explosion has burdened the land to the point that 35% of the land in Nigeria that was farmable 50 years ago is no longer arable. In addition, a major river, Lake Chad, has shrunk. Food and water shortages have led to increasing social instability, which Boko Haram used to their advantage to rise to power. When the government can no longer maintain stability within their country, it creates a vacuum where terrorist groups can emerge. In Nigeria, Boko Haram grows more powerful, while the environmental situation seems to be only getting worse.</p>

<p>A second country that is on everyone&rsquo;s minds right now is Syria. Millions of refugees are fleeing from the oppression and cruelty of ISIS, causing a strain on European resources and leading many people to question what the solution could possibly be. Furthermore, ISIS is wrecking havoc on the countries in the Middle East- Iraq, Iran, Syria- posing a massive international security threat. While the entire world is panicking about this crisis, few look to the origins of this crisis, and how some saw it brewing years ago. An article from the PNAS journal states that &ldquo;there is evidence that the 2007- 2010 drought contributed to<br />
	the conflict in Syria. It was the worst drought in the instrumental record, causing widespread crop failure and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers.&rdquo; (Kelly) This mass migration led to widespread poverty within those urban centers, creating exactly the kind of social instability that fosters the motivation for terrorist groups to form. The drought, combined with Assad&rsquo;s totalitarian, oppressive regime, was a recipe for disaster, and disaster came: ISIS emerged as a credible threat to international security, wrecking havoc in the Middle East region and gaining enough traction to launch attacks overseas.</p>

<p>These are just two examples of what climate change has influenced, in terms of the formation of terrorist groups. But it doesn&rsquo;t end there. If sea levels continue to rise at the same rate, within a number of decades (within our lifetimes!) low-lying islands like Kiribati and Fiji will be underwater. Picture the international conflict that the Syrian refugee crisis is causing. Now multiply that with the number of people who will be international refugees if their homes go underwater. The population of Kiribati and Fiji combined is approximately 1 million. That&rsquo;s 1 million people who will be looking for a new home. It&rsquo;s not a hypothetical situation; Current estimates are that the islands will be uninhabitable within the next 30-60 years. If we have a second refugee crisis on our hands, that creates a breeding ground for new terrorist groups to emerge out of the social instability. These problems aren&rsquo;t going to go away; they will continue to compound and get even more frightening than they are currently.</p>

<p>The issue is not that people don&rsquo;t care. Many, many people care. However, many people think one thing is more important. We have our representatives in the government shouting at each other over whether climate change or ISIS (and the larger problem of terrorism) is more important. The answer to this? You may not believe that a mere high school junior has the answer to this problem, but here it is: They are both important. They do not exist without each other. In order to solve the problem of terrorism, you cannot look at the problem of terrorism alone. Terrorism doesn&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum; There are many different factors influencing it&rsquo;s rise and spread, and ignoring one of those factors just because it doesn&rsquo;t seem as important will have disastrous consequences.</p>
